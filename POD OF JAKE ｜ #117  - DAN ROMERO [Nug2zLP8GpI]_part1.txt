Thank you, Dan, for coming on and joining me on the podcast today. It's great to finally get to speak and I've been having a lot of fun on the platform that you've co-founded or the protocol rather, Farcaster, which you can call a sufficiently decentralized social network. I think it's actually two months to the day that I've been on. It's just been a blast. It's a really great community and I know it's still super early for the ambitious mission that you guys are going to build. So I appreciate you taking the time. And I think for those who don't know you, the best place to start would just be to talk about your story and start as early as you're willing to start and talk about some of the decisions you made along the way. Well, thanks for having me and I'm glad you're enjoying Farcaster. If we want to go back to the beginning, I grew up in Massachusetts. I'm the oldest of four boys. I first kind of fell in love with the internet probably around the time we had AOL, so dial-up connection. And I remember having to ask my parents' permission to be able to go to the computer room, to go on the internet because it would block the phone line and it was limited in the amount of time I got to spend on it. And then in kind of around 2000, I think we got our first broadband connection. And I think that that was kind of the unlock for me in that all you could eat internet and Google had just come out. And so kind of this access to the world's information, I've always been a big fan of the book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the idea of kind of having a computer in your pocket that could access kind of all known information was pretty cool. So obviously when the iPhone came out, that was pretty inspiring. But I think I can remember one thing that I tried to do was I didn't think the internet was fast enough. And so I spent a lot of time on forums on how to potentially hack your cable modem, as well as changing the Windows registry values, which would on the margin improve things. I think some of that was placebo, but it was actually my first kind of diving into the internals of the thing that that got me inspired to just kind of think about how systems work more broadly and especially computers. Self-taught programmer in kind of middle school, high school. It's funny, I never kind of took it super seriously. I don't really have any engineers in my family. And so I didn't kind of think that that was a career that was, I don't know, as appealing or open to me. And so I thought it was more of an interest. And so when we went to college, I ended up majoring in English because I thought I was going to go to law school. And fortunately for me, I did an internship between my sophomore and junior year where I worked at the attorney general's office in Providence, Rhode Island in the narcotics and organized crime unit, which was a fascinating experience. And I got to see how the criminal justice system worked up close, but I quickly realized I had no interest in being a lawyer. And that kind of led me to my junior year of college where I did a little bit of soul searching and ended up kind of doubling down on just what I was interested in, which was technology. And I applied to a remote internship for TechCrunch, the technology news blog, which I think is hard to appreciate for people who are a little younger, how big TechCrunch was at the time. So this is 2009. And effectively the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, tech was kind of this oddity out in Silicon Valley. You know, if you were talking about tech, it was like Microsoft, not these startups. And Michael Arrington had just kind of taken a personal interest of covering companies that he was either considering investing in, had invested in. He was having parties out of his backyard in his house in Atherton. And TechCrunch kind of became this shelling point for technology coverage. I think the YouTube acquisition was announced there. And so it's something I had been reading throughout college. And so I worked on a remote internship. I ended up getting an internship for the summer. So I moved to Palo Alto and I spent a summer in Silicon Valley and I was totally enamored and realized that I definitely wanted to be working in Silicon Valley full time, but I didn't necessarily want to be writing about it. I kind of wanted to be in the arena. And so when I went back my senior year, I applied to consulting jobs because a friend had mentioned that, well, if you have an English degree, but you work in management consulting, at least people will take you a little more seriously as a business person or an entry level business person. So I ended up working at Bain and I did three years of consulting in Boston and then moved to Silicon Valley in 2013 without a job. So I thought I was going to start a company. I had this idea for effectively what was like a data analysis tool based on some of the experiences I had working in management consulting, doing big data analysis for companies. And that really didn't get off the ground. So I interviewed at a bunch of places, got rejected from Airbnb and Dropbox for their like biz ops roles. And then I ended up joining two technical founders working on something called Envoy, which is the visitor sign in system that you, pre-COVID at least, was pretty popular with people when they visit offices in Silicon Valley. It's the iPad that sits out in front. And I joined as kind of a first hire that did pretty much everything. So I did customer service, I did analytics, I did sales. And so all of the kind of roles that were not engineering and design. And I worked at Envoy for almost a year. And in that time, and maybe to just back up, I know this is a little bit of a rambling story, but you wanted the full thing. When I first moved to Silicon Valley, Fred Ersom, one of the co-founders of Coinbase. This is the perfect version. Sorry to interrupt, but keep going. Okay, great. So when I first moved to Silicon Valley, Fred Ersom, one of the two co-founders of Coinbase, someone I'd gone to college with, when I told him I was moving to Silicon Valley, he said, hey, we're actually trying to hire Coinbase. Like we have this huge customer support backlog. We just raised the Series A from Union Square and Ribbit. Do you want to come and work at Coinbase? And I remember kind of thinking, I don't want to work for a Ponzi scheme, like Bitcoin, magic internet money, not my cup of tea. And what was interesting is as soon as I moved to Silicon Valley and actually started meeting other people building things, engineers, it was like every smart person I ran across had an opinion about Bitcoin or wanted to talk about Bitcoin. This is 2013. And I think the thing that really kind of made me take a second look was Coinbase had raised the Series A in March of 2013. And in December of 2013, they raised the Series B from Interest and Horowitz. And we can talk about this later. I've been a big reader of blogs forever and RSS and Fred Wilson and Chris Dixon were two people I had always read their blog and big fans of their writing. And so for these two people who I respected in kind of the Web 2 world, by investing in Coinbase and doing it in the same year, I kind of took a second look at Bitcoin. And I actually sat down and read the white paper a couple of times and then it started to click for me. And then it became an obsession that I could not stop thinking about what you could build with Bitcoin and this idea of a new computing primitive for the kind of stack. So if you think of TCP IP and then you add HTTP on top of that, and then you have browsers and then you got broadband, kind of mobile in my mind. And it was a naive opinion at the time, but it got me interested nonetheless, is that I thought people would be using Bitcoin alongside all these other technologies to actually bank new apps and experiences. And so I applied and ended up getting a job at Coinbase in spring of 2014. And so that was a shift for me from kind of SaaS to a 20 person company. And my first role was on the business development side of things. And I was trying to sign up merchants to accept Bitcoin as a payment method. And in retrospect, that was like poorly thought out from a first principle standpoint. Bitcoin is slow, it's expensive, you have a taxable gain or loss every time you do a transaction. And from a merchant's, it might make sense in the sense that, yeah, you don't have credit card fraud, but from the fact that most consumers don't have it compared to a credit card or debit card means the merchant actually doesn't care. And so that was kind of this false promise of an application for Bitcoin in 2014. But I learned some useful things in doing that. And then actually just because I was on the business development team, later that year, I ended up working on the European expansion for the core business, which is buying and selling Bitcoin with fiat. And so in the US, we had a bank partner, but in Europe, we needed a bank partner that would help us process euros. And so I spent a good chunk of 2014 on the road internationally, meeting with banks all over and we ended up finding a bank in Estonia that was able to process all of our European payments. And it's kind of like the way to think about it, like finding a bank in Rhode Island. Yes, it's the smallest state in the country, but a bank in Rhode Island still has access to the ACH system or the Fedwire system. Similarly, Estonia is a super small country. I think it's like 1.3 million people, but full access to the European payment networks. So that ended up being a big break for me. And so from there, I became kind of the head of international at Coinbase. And while doing that, we actually ended up having some issues with our US banking partner, which prior to me taking that over, it was just kind of Fred and Brian managing it. So I ended up finding the new banking partners in the US, which put me in a position where kind of I was overseeing the core operational relationship for the company. If you think about a company like Coinbase, the businesses take fiat and convert it into at the time, just Bitcoin. But if that doesn't work, then there is no business. And so it kind of set me up for a promotion that I got later to this kind of VP of operations role where going into 2017, and Fred was leaving the company to start Paradigm at that point, I was reporting it to Brian and I was leading all the operational functions of the company for the most part. So in addition to the kind of like core payment relationships, BizDev reported me, BizOps, finance, recruiting, customer support. So there's a bunch of different functions that kind of loosely fall under the thing of responsibility of the VP of ops. But it ended up being crazy timing because, and for those who don't know, 2017 was an incredible year in terms of just total growth in crypto. It makes the actual 2020, 2021 bull market, which in aggregate dollar numbers is bigger, but just on a relative basis, the amount that crypto grew in 2017 was crazy. And I think one data point is I think our revenue in 2016 was somewhere on the order of $10 million. And what ended up happening in 2017 is we finished the year with about a billion dollars in revenue, of which I think like 350 million happened in the month of December. So it was kind of the most crazy work year for me in my entire career in that I had a whole bunch of public failures. The customer support problem was really bad. We just couldn't keep up with hiring, so recruiting is reporting into me. So basically every function that was reporting into me kind of broke and I was learning on the job and doing my best effort. But I think at some point in that year, Brian and I sat down and kind of made the call that we should layer me and hire a COO who had done it before. And I think that ended up being a good decision for a couple of reasons. One, it ended up benefiting the company in that we ended up hiring real executives. Emily Troy, who's now the COO there, was hired during that period. So that was a good decision. It was a good decision for me because I actually think I built more trust with both Brian and the board in the sense that I was willing to kind of put the company first rather than maybe my ego and trying to kind of maintain this, oh, well, I'm the VP of ops, I don't want to get layered. And I think in doing so kind of gave me a lot more freedom within the company in terms of what I wanted to do next, which in kind of after things cooled off in 2018, I took over the consumer business. And so I was the first general manager of what you'd call Coinbase.com in the mobile lab. So that was cool in the sense that I got to focus in, instead of focusing on the broad aspect of the business, focus in on still the most meaningful portion of revenue, but think a little bit more in product terms and work more closely with a team of engineers, designers, and product managers on that part of the business. And then I did that for another year and a half and got to a point where I finally knew it was time to leave. Great. Well, I appreciate you sharing the story. And it's very, very interesting. I've read a lot of what you've written and listened to you on a couple other podcasts and haven't heard like 90% of that. So especially the Coinbase chapter, I usually, I sort of get lucky. I don't ask much of a advanced question to start, but somehow asking for people's early story just ends up being a really interesting answer, I think. And not one that you can often hear as a listener and someone who's been following you on Twitter or something like that. And the early part is always sort of interesting, but even the Coinbase part, obviously very recent, I didn't really know your journey there. And it was really interesting to hear about. I think one thing that is particularly interesting is that you mentioned, you know, you went in and at first sort of the opportunity came up and you didn't really pay much attention and then got to appreciating Bitcoin and, you know, saw that people you admired for their blogs for a long time were investing and seemed to be a lot of, you know, progress and quick momentum there. And so, you know, took a second look and ended up joining. But your first responsibility there, like you said, was sort of working on like with merchants on payments and basically a use case that was anticipated to be a big one from the beginning for Bitcoin that never really panned out or at least hasn't really panned out yet. And going from that sort of, you know, your primary responsibility sort of being something that was almost dead in the water, like there's nothing you personally could have done to have made that use case a success to ultimately running operations to the point where it was just, you know, beyond anything you could even control. I'm curious how you navigated being in that position where like you're new at a company, you're relatively young and you're tasked with this job that just no matter what you do, it's not going anywhere to ultimately sort of diversifying your responsibilities or pivoting them to get responsibilities that gave you the opportunity to prove yourself enough to ultimately sort of be running all of the operations. And then eventually in 2017, when things just got probably too insane for almost anyone to handle, you know, I think it's really interesting that you sort of had that very candid conversation with Brian and everything. But I'm curious, like how did you navigate your way up within Coinbase over time? I think it's two things. So the first is, especially people younger in their career, if they're ending up working at a startup, the amount of effort that you can put into the job and get benefit back from is substantially more than I think most people can appreciate. So opposite example, if you were to work at Google and you're young and you put a ton of effort into your job, the amount that you can actually progress within Google is very much dictated by the corporate hierarchy, which is very driven by tenure. And if someone hasn't done something egregious, probably isn't getting fired anytime soon. So the only time you can potentially move up in the organization on average is if someone leaves. And I think that within a startup, even if the growth isn't happening quite yet, and for a while at Coinbase, there wasn't a ton of growth, the strategic shifts that happen in a small company in search of that growth can offer those types of opportunities. And I think a good example is if you put the effort in on the finding Bitcoin merchants, even if you didn't end up finding a bunch of Bitcoin merchants that turned into a bunch of revenue, how you go about doing that and the level of enthusiasm that you bring to that job, assuming some level of competence, sets you up for the opportunity that comes up to say, hey, we need to go find a bank in Europe. You seem competent enough. You don't really have much experience there, but we don't really have the ability to go hire someone who's a specialist at this point. And so I think that that effort that you put in, even if it's not going to pan out in the existing thing that you're working on, ends up creating the opportunity within the startup that you can actually attach yourself to that ends up working. And look, you have to get some luck involved in that. And then I think that navigating how the organization grows, my advice to anyone working at a startup, especially a high growth startup, is the goal is actually to be at a startup with high growth. And by definition, if you really work at a startup with exponential growth, your ability to scale with that business, especially if you're less experienced, is probably not realistic with maybe the exception of a founder. And I think we're in an era of very founder-friendly boards and VCs because of someone like Mark Zuckerberg where in a traditional era or prior era, people would hire a professional CEO. Look at the Google founders, right? Eric Schmidt. And I think Mark in staying as the kind of founder and CEO of Facebook inspired a whole generation of founders to stay in that role, which means even more so that in order to take an inexperienced founder and scale them, you need to actually put experienced executives around that founder. Because I think having that perspective and realizing that, yes, you might be an early employee and have contributed meaningful amounts to the business. If you're not willing to put your ego aside, then what ends up happening is you end up getting kind of either managed out or you're frustrated and you're mad. Whereas you can flip the situation and realize, well, that's just the reality of the situation. And if I actually approach this as, okay, this is ultimately what's best for the company, which by the way, benefits your equity, you're going to leave an impression, I think, both on the founder who's just trying to kind of figure all this stuff out, but also the board. I think people underrate their visibility at an early stage startup into a board and having a group of board members who are invested in other companies or potentially if you want to be an entrepreneur later, could be backing you, right? Chris was on the board of Quindays and Andrews and Horowitz and-
