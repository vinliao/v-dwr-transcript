of financialization, you should have a very clear understanding of what happens once you're at it, because it's going to magnify whatever behavior, right? And so I think the thing we don't know with Forecaster is, if you go out of financial incentive, like what is immediately the kind of bad behavior that could end up happening that kind of kills the network? And so I think it's been a slower process, but because we've been so deliberate about not having anything like that, the people who are actually using the product today are genuinely using the product because they find it useful and the community interesting, and that is actually starting to compound in a way that we're pretty happy with, as well as the developers, right? And so for us, the focus on making the app useful is the primary benefit. Now, as we think about the kind of future, I actually think one thing that we are very pro is this idea of composability, right? And so the ability for people to permissionlessly start to add financial incentives or tie things in, whether it's with NFTs or DeFi, that's totally fine, and I actually think it should be encouraged, and it shouldn't just be at the kind of client level, just dictating how monetization or something else would happen. And as a result of that, I think we can actually focus on building the primitives that actually make the social network useful, and a lot of the other financialization can maybe be indirect. That said, I do think at some point, like, if the protocol itself, which we actually plan to charge a subscription for, if you effectively want a premium account, you're not paying the company, you're paying the protocol. And so I think that the analog here is, if you've ever used Twitter, an account has a blue check. It's a pretty arbitrary reason Twitter gives people blue checks. In our view is, if you pay the protocol, you should just get, ours are purple, but, like, you get a purple check, as a base-level kind of status distinction. And it actually has a thing within the community that, okay, well, if you're serious about using Forecaster, of course you're going to pay the protocol, because it's kind of showing that you're committed to actually the long-term longevity of it, and you actually start to generate revenue with the protocol, and then I think you can actually figure out the right set of financialization of what behaviors you want to encourage, and then also potentially encouraging developers to build the apps and clients that we think should exist. Yeah, one thing I observed is Signal now has this where you can pay, I think, 5, 10, 20 bucks a month, and you get a little badge. Telegram added this as well recently. Twitter added this. It feels like an underexplored vector for all of social. Well, I also think that, you know, again, it's maybe a generational thing, but I think people dismiss cosmetic upgrades that actually don't mean a lot, right? It's easy to say that they're stupid, but a game like Fortnite or Counter-Strike primarily monetizes through cosmetic skins. It does not make you a better player. It just looks cool, and I think, you know, there's a lot of analogs in the real world. It's like, why does someone have a watch if they have a phone? I don't know. They think it looks cool, and that goes pretty far, especially if you have people spending a lot of time in something, right? Yeah, the amount of time people spend on social, it's very rational to spend 3, 5, 10 bucks a month on a lot of these things, not for all of the users, but maybe 1, 3, 4, 5% of the users, something like that. Okay, so you just talked about people paying in Farcaster to the protocol. This kind of naturally leads to, in the long run, where do you think the equilibrium is between revenue generated by the protocol versus revenue generated by clients? Do you have a strong opinion? How do you think about the problem? Yeah, so I think it's hard to model. My bias, and this is probably showing, like, you know, I kind of grew up in crypto at Coinbase, is I think that there's a lot of value that ends up occurring to clients, because I grew, or kind of model, attention is where the value is. Again, you can monetize attention in a variety of different ways. And I think the fat protocol thesis, for those who kind of know what that is, is I kind of disagree with that in the case of social, because I think the hard work is actually in capturing people's attention, and people don't use protocols, they use apps. Apps can be built on protocols, but I think that the attention is where a lot of the value is. That said, I think that one of the reasons RSS lost to Twitter is RSS itself, for those who don't know, it's kind of this real simple syndication, you can subscribe to blogs. Actually, all of your podcasts get distributed by this protocol still, but it was run by one cranky guy, and he got in a fight with a whole bunch of open source developers, and never made any progress since 2010. But there was no financial mechanism to actually continue to develop the protocol. And I think when you kind of look at, you know, the kind of like Corel, OneChain, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, like there's actually incentive because the actual chains can generate money. And so I actually really, this kind of like subscription to the protocol is actually a mechanic that we're gonna test, but we hope that if it works, it actually creates a very sustainable revenue source for the protocol, so that the protocol, regardless of any given client, can actually continue moving ahead. Another good example of this is email, right? Email is probably one of the most used apps on the internet today, maybe the most used app. And there's no one who's incentivized to really move it forward. And if anything, it's actually at this point controlled by Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. And I don't know if any of you have ever tried to boot up a new domain, like a.xyz domain. You can't get it delivered. It's such a pain to do that. I tried this a couple years ago with this Helm email server thing, and it completely flopped. Right, and so people don't talk about that. It's just like actually, it's not even, you know, open source anymore. It's just controlled by three big companies, and they get to decide the rules for how email works. But if you had actually a sustainable model, and obviously it's pre-crypto, it could actually be very different. And arguably, email would have also done messaging as an open standard rather than WhatsApp capturing that value or something else. Okay, I think last question, and then maybe we have some Q&A. What are some of the interesting things being built on top of Farcaster today? You highlighted SearchCaster a few minutes ago. Anything else that you wanna highlight? Yeah, so just another simple one is, for those who are familiar with a website, Hacker News, which is just a kind of series of links. It's run by Y Combinator. It's very popular with developers. Someone just built that on top of Farcaster. But what's interesting is, if you actually just think about it, a lot of people in a Twitter feed are sharing links, right? And each time a link is shared, that's kind of like a vote. And so what someone did is they just took the data set, again, permissionlessly, and was able to just display it in a way that just looks very similar to something like Hacker News. And what's interesting is you can't do this on Twitter today because Twitter wouldn't give you access to the full fire hose and probably would shut you down at some point. And people find it extremely useful. And this is a product that it took a developer a weekend to kind of put together. And so it's a great example that I actually think there's just gonna be a lot more of these experiments, and maybe some of these end up turning into the kernels for really large businesses. But the thing that I'm most excited about, that we just recently launched in our own client, and a lot of this is informed by TikTok, is so I actually personally hate algorithmic feeds. I'm like a reverse chronological. I wanna follow who I follow, and I want it in the exact, like an email inbox. But the reveal preference for most users in social is they want TikTok, right? And if you actually look at all the major social networks, they're all moving towards an algorithmic feed like TikTok, where the concept of following someone doesn't matter nearly as much as just if you spend time on that, they're gonna show you stuff like that again. And so I'm actually really interested, given that the data set for Forecaster is open, is actually allowing the kind of like world of data scientists on the internet to actually start developing their own algorithms, and then allowing you to subscribe to different people's algorithms within our client. And so it effectively creates a marketplace for the best algorithm. I view that as it's actually a really easy way for people to test out an interesting idea, and if it ends up working and their algorithm gets a lot of views, again, going back to this idea that we need to be a steward for both the protocol and our own business, is we're not gonna immediately just clone that algorithm. What I'd like to do is actually figure out a way, can you actually subscribe to that algorithm or create effectively a monetization model so that other developers in the ecosystem that are providing value actually can build meaningful businesses, which I think further brings developers in the ecosystem and then ultimately more users. ♪♪♪
