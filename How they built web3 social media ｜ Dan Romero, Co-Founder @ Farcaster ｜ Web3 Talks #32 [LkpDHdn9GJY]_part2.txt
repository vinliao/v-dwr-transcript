yourself and he didn't even have to ask me for permission to build this this bot it just kind of was able to happen and it's incredibly popular right and you actually get a lot of new users who follow it as a way to sample oh are these new people coming in how's their content without necessarily even having to follow them it kind of something that we didn't come up with on our own and ended up being a really good feature the interesting thing that you said about adding friction is that on the like higher level you go against the common wisdom that if you are a VC funded startup you need to grow fast because you know if you add friction and people need to DM you on Twitter like you know someone on Forrecaster calculated that if you get like 50 people on board it every day so you'll get 2 million in like 20 years or something like that so this is very counterintuitive to go for slow growth so I'm wondering like why have you made this choice I think part of its informed by just seeing how some of the social products of the last few years have played out and I think to step back again like look at a little bit of history as well as just first principles where are we in 2022 so with history what's the most successful social network Facebook Facebook was invite only for two plus years right you had to have at first it was based on the school you were at and then eventually it was a dot edu email address but for to think of Facebook the most successful network has actually been gated and for the time that it was the way it was described as the college social network and it was so much smaller in comparison to my space which was the general purpose social network I think people under appreciate that in terms of why did Facebook end up winning and I think if you build an engaged user base that is high quality and here it's a rough proxy right like college students being high quality versus just general any signup that becomes a high status thing where people then actually want to join that network and I think the other thing is if you build a product especially in crypto and you can kind of say this even with Twitter there are a lot of bot accounts and kind of people just if they can programmatically create something they're just gonna do a bunch of it because it potentially is useful for them for whatever nefarious purpose they want to do that for and I think you run into an issue and I'm still trying to formulate this but it's kind of this concept of you have a total number of daily active users on any social product and especially a public one where you can kind of see the other profiles it's like one thing I don't know if you know about be real or some of these other networks where it's a little tighter where you might have a group of 10 friends and then it's fine you can almost think of it as like a like a messaging app is actually very similar to this and that if you have a few conversations you'll actually be a daily active user regardless of whether there are you know a thousand people using that app or a hundred million people using that app but if you think about the kind of ghost town problem of if the daily active users to the total number of signups feels like hey I'm one of the thousand people who's using this app every day but there are a hundred thousand people who signed up just doesn't feel cool it feels like those ninety nine thousand people figured out like this isn't isn't useful anymore and so I think that from that standpoint what we're actually trying to build is this kind of ratio of daily active users to total number of signups and if we for whatever period add a number of new signups that churn especially on the kind of like one month or three month mark which is I think a lot farther out you know you have a terminal product right like if you can't retain people over the long term at a consistent rate you're just it's just the time function of yeah you can add a whole bunch of people go viral you know get really high vanity metric numbers of total number of signups but if over time you're just leaking those users out because fundamentally their problems and either the product or the quality of the network and all that then basically you're you're dead and so I think Varun and I don't want to just have a social network that we can say oh look we got up to a million or ten million people to sign up and then it kind of fizzles out I'd rather be small for a while and be building a product that people actually want to use every day and that's another thing I think a lot of people love talking about signups which is a cumulative metric very few people like talking about DAU because daily active users and DAU is really hard because to be a daily active user if you're kind of taking that as an average that's like a vote of confidence every single day that the app is providing you some amount of value whereas you can trick someone to open up an app I don't know once a month with a push notification or an email or something like that and so by just kind of working on the hard thing it forces our focus whether it's in the product or the protocol to actually be delivering something of value to users and if it's not happening then that's on us to figure it out and so I think where we want to be is consistent growth so 5% weekly growth is our target which actually relatively straightforward to do right now but if you know about compounding 5% weekly over the course of two or three years starts to get much harder and I think that that philosophy also allows us especially given our team is small to grow into any bit of growth right so if now all of a sudden the network feels lower quality for whatever reason or we're running into some I don't know harassment issues or whatever the issue might be we have the breathing room to actually solve that from a product and then potentially even on a protocol level whereas if you're just on kind of this runaway exponential growth train it's like this compounding problem that only gets worse and in some ways I actually saw this at Coinbase right where we had done a lot of work from 2014 to 2016 to build systems that for the previous kind of boom which was in the 2013-2014 era and then you had this exponential growth that happened in 2017 and just everything every time we thought we had fixed the system it would it would like grow again to a new peak and it was just this really challenging situation where you had these terrible customer experiences because it's very very difficult to build as a team in an exponential way like people tend to build more I think linearly and so what you ended up having is like in the 2018-2019 era Coinbase did a whole bunch of scaling and then in 2021 like it just broke again because you hit new heights and so I think some of that is informed the way we think about is like can we work on building this really high quality engaged user base consistently growing but also make sure that the product and protocol is kind of growing reasonably alongside it and I think it'll only get harder but for now especially given the team is small I think it's for us I think at this point it works like you have this really magical moments there like for example you know Chris Dixon who is not that active on Twitter because you know he he has like a pretty official Twitter account there like you can see him just like hanging out and commenting some people who have like 20 followers sometimes what does he think and you have these stories where you know you just you have NFT feed on on Fardcaster and you can just accidentally discover some cool NFTs because you see that your friends minted something you can also you know have better engagement than on Twitter like this JMJ like he had this post where you know having I don't know like he has like 10k followers on Twitter or even more and he gets like five comments maybe and he posts something on Fardcaster where he has like 200 followers and he get like 50 comments or something like that so this is really powerful and this network density like you can really you can really feel it in the air and somehow there's also like very interesting choice that you made and I'd like to ask you about it because there's no quote tweets which is a perfect engagement farming mechanism for Twitter like product manager who invented this I guess he has a act as big as Jeff Bezos right now but like you know obviously it's not good for the quality of interactions it's great for likes it great for sharing disconsent but I'm not sure it's very good for the vibes on the app so I'm wondering like what was your rationale behind it and you know do you plan to implement it at some point or what's your take let me address a couple of things so first I think on the just be intellectually honest so Chris investor in our company Merkle Manufacturer which is building Farkaster so part of that is he's using the product because he's an investor that said I think if you were to talk to Chris or someone with a similar sized audience on Twitter I think that there are a bunch of things that happen on Twitter today that make it kind of unusable especially for a person with a big audience in crypto so one you have all these spam bots right so you you're Vitalik or CZ or Elon or any of these people and that you post something and it's just this infinite number of just like people giving away crypto that they're scams with like Elon or Vitalik it just is a really bad experience and I think that you know if you have a huge audience it's like do you really want to put something out and then just right next to your profound insight is just like a bunch of spam I actually think if Elon buys Twitter he'll solve that so you know that's maybe just a momentary thing but I think this is a separate thing of and this goes back to what I described Farkaster is today it's it's a community of people who are curious about crypto and web3 we put an emphasis early on of trying to find people who are kind of developers entrepreneurs people building things I'd say on average the community is more optimistic and earnest and to your point about quote tweets which I actually think ties nicely one thing that we're making a conscious decision on at least in our client which is the kind of initial client for Farkaster but but has an influence on how the network is growing right we're onboarding people into the network and the conversations the issue with a quote tweet which by the way was not invented by Twitter it was invented by users in third-party clients they used to put QT and like a good company they saw this and then actually implemented in a way that is a a well executed feature with some potential maybe intended consequences but I would call unintended consequences is basically quote tweets when used correctly like are actually really useful because it kind of adds some additional commentary but can also rebroadcast to the audience whereas when used in what I would say incorrectly or kind of like maliciously they're basically just used for dunks right and in the simple example I always say is I'm having a conversation with you at a party in kind of like a semi-public someone can come over and listen and it would be the equivalent of me walking up or someone else walking up to that conversation and saying hey everyone look at this idiot over here what he's saying and I'm gonna take this one thing out of context and and nothing like and just broadcast it with commentary to my team which gets farming and likes and all that kind of stuff so I actually think it's a relatively especially if you have a big audience and maybe you have more polarizing opinions or just unconventional opinions it's naturally gonna attract haters and so I think with with forecaster what we've made the explicit decision is what we want to actually encourage our conversations and so you can actually accomplish the same thing as a quote tweet today so the way to do it maybe it's not intuitive but if you recast our version of a retweet the original and then you reply anyone who's following you will see that and then your reply so you're still getting that like kind of post and the context but it comes in a different way of you actually now as a user if you click through it you're gonna see all the rest of the context so I think that like one example the reality is it's a little like trying to kind of keep your finger in a dam as it's starting to break is like people actually want quote tweets and threads is another good example very popular in Twitter we tend to kind of I don't know discourage in terms of even in the UI not making it easy to add threads because I personally don't like threads we could talk about it I prefer something like a screenshot essay or a blog post but the idea that we have for at least for our client is if users are trying to still do something can we actually rethink the feature in a way that optimizes for the behavior that we want on the network and in our case we are really trying to create engaging conversations where people I think of a successful interaction on farcaster is Alice posts Bob responds Alice responds and that to me is a sign of right because if Alice posts and a bot responds Alice is not going to respond to that or Alice posts and Charlie responds but Charlie is like saying you know F you Alice won't respond to that but but anything that you're basically getting a BA and admit potentially even deeper is a sign of like there's something happening even if it be is disagreeing with a it's more civil right and you know obviously you can get in a fight but I think that's like what we want to nudge it towards rather than I think some of the what I would call mature Twitter dynamics of 2022 where it's really about find something that's on team a and broadcast it to your team in a way with commentary to show how witty and cynical and smart you are and here's the thing as far castor gross people are gonna build all their clients and if that is actually what people want this like dunk fest of kind of broadcast you know the hot takes to your team that client will out compete like it'll beat our client people will actually use it that will be the reveal preference but I suspect that if you actually have this opinionated point of view and you say this is the behavior that we want to reward on the network like anything that's actually gonna get any type of algorithmic distribution on our client is gonna be biased towards that I suspect you will have a different vibe on the network in the same way that I don't think Twitter and LinkedIn are the exact same thing or Facebook and LinkedIn or you know Instagram and Twitter they have different norms I think that is a thing I'm thinking a lot about and it's like how can you actually in the product choices as well as the protocol choices instill a set of norms that make far caster different than Twitter and you know hopefully a year from now when I say well what is far castor it feels more like its own thing versus saying it's like Twitter but for people who are interested in web 3 incredible just a short break to remind you that if you like this podcast please don't hesitate to subscribe and give it a five-star review on Spotify Apple podcasts or whatever platform you use thanks a lot yeah I think also you know you lead with example like you are the most active community manager I've seen in a long time because you're super active on forecast and trying to you know just spread good vibes and good standards and let's get to the developer point of view for a second because you mentioned clients and people might be obviously aware of clients when it comes to email like you can have like Gmail or like superhuman or like Yahoo mail or whatever but it's counterintuitive when it comes to social networks because they are closed basically so what kind of clients could you have like what would be the difference between experience between client a and client B like what could you change between these options so I think in clients in three different ways so the first is what actually is being built on Forecaster today and they're they're somewhat primitive I'm excited for all of them but most of them are kind of a they index all of the data on Forecaster and then they present a view right so it might be search engine search caster instacaster is take all of the posts that have an image and kind of display it in a way that looks like Instagram another good example is there's one called any caster where you can type in any username and because the data is publicly available you can generate the feed so you can see the world through someone else's eyes right like a feature I've kind of always think Twitter had it for a hot second and then got rid of it for whatever reason but all of this is just any developer has any idea they can kind of go do because the data is all accessible one of the limitations of the initial version of Forecaster we call that Forecaster v1 which we're on still today is it's very difficult to build a client that does read and write all right so right being that I can actually use the client to post information back into the Forecaster protocol which will show up in any other clients right the analogy here being like imagine if you had an email client where you couldn't respond to people but all you could do is read the emails that you got right so not as useful so we've spent a lot of work over the last six months trying to get Forecaster the protocol the underlying thing that kind of makes everything work to a place where read write is easy enough for a motivated developer to go build and so I suspect once we're kind of done with this migration hopefully by the end of the year we are gonna start to see the first competing clients to the one we've built our company Merkel manufacturing you'll actually have it kind of so the analogy here would be like gmail versus hotmail or another good example of this in browsers right it's like Chrome or Safari it's like you're using a piece of software that kind of does basically the same thing as what the other one does but with some aesthetic differences and then maybe some kind of like features here or there the third class of clients and the one I'm like most excited about in the long term is people starting to depart from like kind of just the like functionality that already exists today and then fundamentally come up with new social primitives and new types of functionality so an example from web 2 is snapchat created this concept of stories which then Instagram copied very well and kind of you know you think of stories now is very much an Instagram phenomenon but that's the kind of stuff where that type of new social primitive enables a new type of social behavior online and that I think is the key to actually having forecaster succeed in the long run is that if that if it becomes the expert the place where people experiment with new social primitives then I think it it has a shot at winning as a protocol because the marginal developer who like wants to build a new social experience is going to be hacking on top of the forecaster protocol not on phone books or whatever web two things so a good example that I'm excited about with forecaster you have a strong guarantee that every user is represented by a public and private key happens to be an Ethereum address and that's important because you get all these really nice properties of public and private keys they kind of are to use the term composable which people refer to stuff in DeFi but I actually think from a cryptography standpoint you can do a lot with them and kind of layering and and zero knowledge proofs are this kind of area of academic research that is kind of being implemented in the first ways in a lot of ways in cryptocurrency but I think that by having a an expanding social graph of active users who are represented by public and private keys developers can permissionally start to build experiences that leverage zero knowledge proofs to do new types of speech and the example I like to give is the US Constitution was ratified partially because of a group of three of the kind of founding fathers Alexander Hamilton John Jay and James Madison had a pseudonym called Publius in a New York newspaper where they wrote a series of you know dozens of essays about why the Constitution was important and should be approved specifically to try to convince the people of New York to ratify it and so you could imagine that type of primitive now existing in a way that no company or individual could actually ever prove someone said one thing but you could say okay these three top-tier I don't know scientists celebrities venture capitalists developer pick a group of people politicians can actually all post to a group account but none of the other people actually know who that person would be and I think if you start to get into that realm of like just primitives that now exist where developers can permissions to experiment you you may find yourself in a situation where you're gonna have a bunch of new forms of speech that are uniquely enabled by by the set of primitives on the network and so that's what I'm most excited about with clients is moving from kind of read the data which is still important and useful right to kind of like have competing functionality to on a mentally new functionality that's where we need to get to but I think if you just kind of think about it like if you don't even have any users
