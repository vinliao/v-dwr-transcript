like I see this in Ethereum and then you have like SpongeBob. I can still make the point, but it kind of by definition is like a little bit more cheeky. So that would be my other piece of advice. Yeah. They're actually a deeply textured format. Like there's a lot of depth to them because conveying something with humor and irony and like not saying what you're exactly saying, but saying it between the lines. Like there's, it's a pretty, you know, deep. And the fact that it's like so funny and doesn't take itself so seriously only makes it more interesting. So you might call that Straussian or something where like you can actually communicate multiple messages to multiple groups with plausible deniability, which I think that's actually important. Right. Be like, Whoa, I put a picture of SpongeBob up. Don't take that as a treatise. Right. So. Yeah. Awesome, man. Well, I think let's close here. This was a lot of fun. Thanks for having me.
