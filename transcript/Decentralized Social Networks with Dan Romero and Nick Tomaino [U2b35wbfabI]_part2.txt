Can you set the default to highlight right now or no? No, that's the other thing is I can't stand that Twitter. I've been using Twitter for 15 plus years and every time I get to the app, I don't wanna see the algo. I wanna see the following first. I'll tap the algo if I'm bored. Yeah, got it. But here, like to be intellectually honest though, consumers, like the average consumer prefers the algo. They do not prefer reverse chronological. That is a power user feature. But a network like Twitter is interesting in that the power users are the ones that create the actual liquidity and the content. So you have to provide power users, I think with the best possible experience. And on the margin, they're gonna create more compelling content, which is actually gonna pull in the people who want the algo feed. I think this is what Twitter is always not kind of like rock, right? Like if I'm above a certain number of followers on Twitter and I'm posting on a regular basis, I should never see an ad of my feed. Like there are not that many people on Twitter like that. Like all they should be doing is trying to focus on, it's like, how can I get this person to post more? Because this is actually going to bring in the 200, whatever their fake metric they've had. They've had this like monetizable DAU number, which anytime you see a social network that doesn't use DAO, just like Facebook, it's coke. It's basically, we aren't Facebook. We don't wanna be compared to Facebook. We don't actually have a compelling enough product to drive DAO. And so they come up with all these other metrics. Talk to anyone who's like, Facebook has the two best metrics from a social network standpoint, DAO and time spent. And I think there was a question in the chat that says, how do you measure reveal preference? Daily active users. Like that's the only number you should be looking at because to be a daily active user, that's a vote of utility every single day, right? Like to keep coming back. Probably means that the app is on their home screen. Monthly active user, I can send you an email that kind of like tricks you into clicking on the app and all I have to do with that is once a month. Like it is a completely different mindset to build an app that someone would wanna use every day, let alone multiple times a day. And I think that is something that we're really focused on because that is the ultimate vote of, are we building something useful as people are willing to use it every single day. Do you think about the question of whether, you said that what users want is the algorithmic feed that just drives engagement, but do you consider that what users want might actually be bad for them? And is that something that you think about in building the product, particularly as a protocol kind of first that might have a different business model than advertisement, right? Because in the case of Twitter, and maybe they're trying to get away from this now, but like what users want might be bad for them, but it also aligns with the business model. So I think there's different considerations. I'm curious how you balance that. And maybe you disagree with my premise that what users want might be bad for them, but. Yeah, I'm generally at the point of view is that the market actually is, going back to the stated versus revealed preference. If you have a true market and it's kind of like the barrier to entry is low, which today in social networks, you get these massive network effects and then they can actually be rent extracting. Monopoly is not the right word, but within their social graph, they effectively are. Television is a great example of this. So when television didn't have kind of like barriers, the barriers to entry was extremely high, right? Like spectrum, and like you only had a few networks. There's a very limited, like A, what was allowed to be on TV in terms of content. The format was pretty standard. It's like, okay, advertising based. Like you couldn't opt in. HBO comes along with the beginning of cable. And then as over time, as you kind of like lower the barrier to entry, and then especially with the internet where effectively streaming, like you could just kind of come over the top, like the reveal preferences, consumers actually are willing to pay some amount of money for baseline better content, right? Like network television is effectively toast relative to Netflix or HBO or Disney Plus. And so I think that that is what I wanna get to for social media is can we actually get to a market where there's a sufficient network effect happening at a protocol level that you actually get to see a competing set of approaches, right? You have the paid clients, the subscription, the HBO equivalent. You have the ad free with ads, which I think a lot of people will still pick those types of clients. You'll have the algorithmic clients that are like totally engaging in terms of just trying to suck you in for multiple hours at a time, versus like one of the approaches that we have for our client is if I get people to pay as a subscriber, A, I shift them from a user to a customer. And then I actually care much more about something like NPS. So like customer satisfaction of versus time spent, right? If you're an advertising based platform, the only number that matters for you if you wanna make more money is increasing time spent, which then shows you more ads, right? Whereas in an environment where I all of a sudden have paying subscribers, maybe what my paying subscribers are saying to me is I want a better signal to noise ratio. Show me less content in my feed, but using algorithms, show me the most relevant for me. And then at a certain point say, hey, everything else after this is gonna be doom scrolling. I think for a busy person who's trying to make informed decisions about the world, they would be willing to pay a lot for that, right? And so I think that the key is getting to a marketplace of ideas and a marketplace of clients and approaches. And then going back to the state versus reveal preference, we're gonna see what actually most consumers want or different populations of consumers. Makes sense. What are some of the most interesting, I mean, you don't wanna highlight maybe one or the other, but are there any, from a user perspective, products kind of built on Farcaster that you really like? I mean, for me, SearchCaster, and I'm guessing you are as well as a Twitter power user, but I use Search quite a bit. And the one thing that Farcaster lacks in the client right now, I think is Search. And so SearchCaster, if anyone wants to check it out, I dropped it in the chat, but it's kind of one of my favorite products that's kind of built on the open data layer, but maybe talk about a few that you think are particularly interesting. Yeah, so SearchCaster was great in the sense that it was permissionlessly built. Had no idea, Greg Skriloff, just recent college graduate, just built it because he was excited about searching what was on Farcaster. And from our internal prioritization, we were saying, well, there's not enough content on Farcaster right now to justify us going and spending time on Search versus some other feature. But the beauty of a protocol is if you're not solving what the market wants or someone's preference, they can go build it. And so I think SearchCaster is just like a great encapsulation of you actually increase the aggregate amount of output or innovation that's happening in the ecosystem when it is permissionless and open. So we actually haven't felt the compelling need to go build Search now because SearchCaster exists, right? And you can imagine as Farcaster grows as a protocol, being the search engine for the protocol could end up being something that's pretty valuable. I'd fully expect, by the way, that there are gonna be much of other competitors to SearchCaster. So I think that's the kind of the flip side of the coin here is that you actually have to constantly be building the best consumer experience or kind of like product experience because the barrier entry is so low, which I think is exciting because at the end of the day, then you get the best consumer experience possible because everyone's competing for that attention. I think where I'm most excited right now is we have a bunch of other clients being built. And so maybe that term kind of can get confusing. The simplest example here is just think of like web browsers. That's a client for the web, the original one Netscape, then in Microsoft, then you have Firefox and Chrome and Safari. And so I think where we are today is we're kind of like the Netscape equivalent. And what we're hoping is that there's actually a bunch of other people who can provide that same core gateway service to the protocol. And for the first two years, no one was interested in it. And I think last year we had our first like kind of like fully featured, like gonna show you a feed and another client, Discov, again, permissionless built by a developer in Berlin. And then as of the start of this year, we have, I'm aware of at least six teams that are working on clients that could fully replace, like you would never have to use our main client. And so this is kind of, again, going back to that idea of like, if we had judged the success of the protocol after the first year, we basically had no developer interest, might as well just shut it down. But I think for us, it's always been about consistent growth of the total daily active users of the protocol is going to be the thing that actually attracts developers. And the analogy I always like to use is the iPhone. So when the original iPhone came out, they sold somewhere between five and 10 million of them. There was no third-party app store. You could, the only like first-party apps were built by Apple. Apple even built the YouTube and Google Maps apps. And so it's easy to forget that for that first year, they were the one just selling the device based on the existing feature set. And once they got to that kind of initial community of, and if you're carrying around a phone, you're a daily active user of the phone, that's the second year when they launched the app store. And then even then, those first couple of years, if you actually just look, like you type TechCrunch, like top apps in the app store 2009, most of those apps don't exist today. And it took a few years for people to natively understand, oh, this is the capability of this device that people are carrying around all the time. You get the WhatsApps, you get the Instagrams, you start to get the actual like mobile native companies that have grown up while this is a platform. And I think that that's the same thing that's happening with Farcaster where the initial set of ideas are kind of like tinker projects. And then I think that they start to get more sophisticated as you've grown the total number of people on the protocol, because that's actually what developers care about. They don't care about the underlying technology of a protocol for the most part. They care about is liquidity. And in the case of DeFi, that's total value locked or whatever. And in the case of social, it's daily active users, right? Like the liquidity that generates the both the posts, but the eyeballs, right? How do you incentivize developers? Because I guess like the app store example, developers came because there were users, but also because there was a way to make money. I guess first just in the app store charging for your app, but also advertising became kind of a business model. So what do you, it's awesome that there's six clients in the works right now. How are these developers thinking about incentives? And do you think kind of incentive alignment between yourself as Merkle, the company, and the developers is important? Maybe share more on how you're thinking about that. Yeah, so I'm back to the markets thing. I think if you just strip away all incentives, hackathons, all these other kinds of stuff, the thing that developers care about is I wanna build something and I want people to use it. And so driving the total number of addressable daily active users and making sure the technology works, right? Like right now, like we have a bunch of stuff that we still need to kind of go figure out, but here's a simple example. With Farcaster, where we should be in the next six months is you see an app in your feed that is kind of Farcaster enabled. You can tap that. It's gonna take you to that app. And then you can kind of swipe once to just kind of sign in with Farcaster. And then that app magically has access to your kind of credentials in the background. And then you can go use that. Getting to that level of just kind of distribution for kind of like a crypto or web three app where you're not having to muck around with MetaMask or any of these other things. And it just kind of feels much more like installing an app from the app store. I think that is a 10X improvement for developers to be able to get the distribution and people to actually go use their app. And the thing I would push on is, yeah, the app store let you charge money, but Apple actually charges for that. And in theory, you could do it outside the app store. The reveal preferences consumers really enjoy this like really seamless experience to get an app. And so I actually think convenience, and this is something that we learned at Coinbase, that's a reveal preference for consumers. Yes, you can go store your Bitcoin or Ether, whatever you have with a user controlled wallet. But the reveal preferences is that most people like to keep it safe on Coinbase because that's password reset and all these other kinds of things. And so I think where we're really focused on is if we can make this the most seamless way to onboard into kind of like web three or crypto. And in most cases, the user doesn't even necessarily even need to know about it. But then the kind of, I always use the mullet example. It's like kind of feels web two in the front, business in the front, and then like party web three in the back. But like that's the actual architecture of Farcaster. And so you get to a place where we make it really, really easy to onboard. We're growing the total number of daily active users in this ecosystem. And I can actually show like, hey, people are using this app every single day. Like we're focused on DAOs, not MAUs. Developers are gonna show up. Like they're desperate for growth. They're desperate for that set of first thousand or 10,000 users. And so I think that is the single biggest thing that we can do to drive developer adoption versus any thing on the margin. I think if we get to some level of scale, we will have the ability to kind of figure out because there is going to be a fee associated with a Farcaster account, but you can kind of think of it as like Twitter blue, but you're paying a smart contract on Ethereum. And from that, I think we can, if we can prove that we can get a scaled number of users to pay for a premium account to a protocol, then I actually think you can think about how do you divvy that up? Maybe some developers are actually contributing more to the usage of that. So maybe they get rewarded for that, but that's so far in the future. And I think that the primary focus is just continue to drive the total number of daily active users in the ecosystem. Got it. So do you think, I think there's not, you could argue it's not at scale, but there's a number of people using Farcaster right now that would pay right now. Do you think that would be something that you kind of add even before you open it up to more people and maybe ungate it? Or how are you, and maybe are there metrics that you're tracking before you want to ungate it? Maybe talk a little bit about just how you're thinking about roadmap. Yeah, so we have three big milestones to get the protocol to what I would say is kind of like a credibly neutral permissionless, something that I would actually, from an intellectual honesty standpoint, say this is a permissionless Ethereum. So the first is we have to get this kind of special server out a node for the Farcaster network called the hub. So that's in May. And what's nice about that is after that's done, a developer can just go to GitHub, pull down this Farcaster hub code, run it in their own infrastructure, and they will have full access to the global state of the network. So there is no privileged like, oh, Merkle, because they created it, they have all this additional data. It's just, you get the exact same state and that's how Ethereum works. And I think that that's a critical component to being able to look a developer in the eye and say, hey, go build a business, spend the next few years trying to build something on top of this protocol. Because if you don't hit that level, you get to what happened with Twitter, which Twitter, the early days of Twitter, you had this robust third-party ecosystem of developers, strategy change in 2014, that got kind of handicapped. And then Elon shows up and then just overnight says, hey, sorry, the remaining Twitter API, that's getting deprecated in two weeks. So I think developers at this point are sophisticated enough to think about platform risk. And so getting to a place of that credible neutrality, the unruggable protocol from a social standpoint, that's really critical. Second thing is we need to get to Ethereum mainnet and prove that people are willing to pay for that premium account to the protocol. That's a hypothesis right now. I think to your point, there's a dedicated group of early users that are kind of indicating interest, but getting someone to part with their hard-earned cash, like that's a reveal preference and we need to get to that point. And then the third part is getting out of this gated state, right? Like how do you go from kind of Facebook gated.edu to anyone in the world can go sign up. And I think that comes down to, I'm just like relentlessly focused on just your standard retention metrics, right? So because it's gated right now, actually signups, like that's fine. Like most people we send a signup to are gonna make it through the signup, but the day one retention, day seven retention, day 30 retention of just like what percentage of users if they sign up, like come back 30 days later, I want that to be basically top 10% with any web two social network. And if we hit that point, which I feel pretty confident that we're gonna be able to get there this year, like we're already top 25%, but if we can get to top 10%, then you know that you have a machine that for every user you add into the machine, you're gonna retain X percent, like that becomes something that you can actually compound. And then I think you can shift more towards a growth mentality. The last thing that I think is interesting is I don't think we're ever gonna grow as fast as the traditional web two social networks because of this single on-chain fee, right? Like the rest of Forecaster's off-chain, the architecture I think is really, really designed to make it usable, but that on-chain fee, some people would say, oh, that's never gonna get you to a billion users. And the counter to that, I would say, is actually that might be fine for the foreseeable future because what you end up getting is you get built-in spam prevention, right? If it costs a dollar or $5 to just even sign up that initial account, and we can have it have a slick Apple Pay integration, you might even need to see the crypto, right? It can just happen behind the scenes, but then you don't run into any of these problems that Twitter has dealt with. And so what you can actually confidently say is if you have 10,000 followers on Forecaster, you have a much higher confidence that those are 10,000 real people. Like you could actually put them in a stadium and be there versus 10,000 followers on Twitter, like could end up being like 3,000 people in a bunch of bots. So I think shifting the narrative also around the quality of your audience. And the other thing we can do is we can measure the on-chain activity of those people. So now all of a sudden, and this is a biology concept, is you can actually start to measure the economy size, the on-chain economy size of your audience, right? Like biology, I always used to bring this up where he would say, imagine if Kim Kardashian could actually say the 200 million people who follow her on Instagram, like this is how much economic activity they generate. Well, with a network like Forecaster, and if you believe more stuff was gonna end up on chain, you can quantitatively in a permissionless way, like know exactly how much economic activity are the 10,000 people who are following me on Forecaster. And so I think that that, once we figured that out, I think then we're in a more of a growth mode because we're actually selling a different product than just something that looks like Twitter, but is not.
