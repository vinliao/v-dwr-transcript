experience at the protocol level, informed by that kind of year's worth of usage. Yeah, I don't think I've heard the term conversation liquidity before. I think it's amazing. I think that's like, I don't know if you coined it, but we're going to make it a thing. So yeah, 3000-ish users, you get a cast every minute. So you're pretty much onboarding like early power users. And I've heard from a lot of people like, hey, Farcaster's amazing because like a lot of the noise is gone, like people who are on it really care about what they're talking about. And so like, I mean, this is the obvious question with any social app, when you think about curation, which is very much like, you know, you heavy, which is quality versus quantity. So as you open up the beta, as you start to onboard more people, as it gets more quote unquote noisy, how do you think about that balance? So we're figuring it out. I don't claim to have a perfect solution. We plan to stay invite only. First, kind of in this model where it's DM me on Twitter to get access to the network. And a lot of people are doing the referrals, right? So it's someone telling a friend, they're showing it at a conference, like, hey, look at this app. And then people DM me and say, I saw this, you know, a friend showed it to me. I think we need to move that to a community driven model. Like that's much more sustainable just from the fact that I probably can't manage my DMs on Twitter beyond much more than where we are today. But the goal is to actually for the first million users to keep it invite only. And we don't wanna kind of go vertical in terms of the growth rate, because I actually think that can overwhelm the network. And so we're targeting something along the lines of 5% weekly growth, compounded over multiple years to kind of get there. Maybe it ends up being a little higher, but that's still multiple years before we get to a million users. And I think that if we take that deliberate slow growth approach, assuming people continue to find the network useful, as we scale, we are going to run into inevitable issues around quality, the community feels like it's getting bigger and not as intimate as it was before. And I think it can really help force us on our product, right, like we built this initial client. And if we continue to be active users of the network, how do we actually make the experience feel as intimate as it was when it was maybe smaller? And so I think part of that is just kind of paying attention, responding to user feedback, talking to users on a frequent basis, and then trying to kind of think about what are the smart defaults that we can set in the client, assuming we're gonna continue to be one of the larger clients, that reward behavior on the network that we think is correlated with quality and the direction we wanna head. And so one example I'll give you, we have the concept of a like on Farcaster, and we have the concept of a retweet, we call it a recast on Farcaster. But the very simple algorithmic feed, so we kind of have a normal reverse chronological feed, and then we have an algorithmic feed, we call it highlights. We have made an explicit decision that the highlights feed should highlight the most active and engaged conversations on the network, not necessarily the thing that has the highest like count, which I think if you strictly let a machine learning algorithm that was optimized towards time spent in engagement go wild, you inevitably are going to have the posts that get the most likes and recasts. But if you actually are kind of making a human level, hey, this is actually what we wanna kind of nudge the community towards, it's still gonna have its version of gaming and people trying to figure out how to hack the algorithm. But I think if you view the social network algorithm much more like a game developer would, and so to use the kind of term, there's this kind of term in games like a Dota or League of Legends where they nerf overpowered strategies and then they buff the underpowered ones, assuming you kind of wanna continue to add balance. I think that that's a mentality that we are hoping to bring as we grow towards that million users. And I think if we can actually make it to that point and still have a highly engaged and kind of active community, I think roughly around a million, you can actually open up signups and the product probably is more mature in that it can handle all the inevitable things that start to come with an open signup network. And I'm happy to talk about those because obviously as soon as you open it up to anyone on the internet, it gets a little messier. 100%, yeah, for sure the messy part. And I wanna touch on the messy part, but to kind of respond to what you're saying, like I think even a million, that's a big number, but it can still be majority self-selecting in terms of the people that are on the platform. Obviously being online, super beneficial in some ways, building your brand, meeting people that you otherwise would never meet across the world. All of that is the great stuff, but the really, really, really not great stuff is opens you up for harassment, for bullying. And I think in recent years, it's just gotten, especially you hear about certain platforms getting super toxic. And so I guess on an open platform, how would curation and moderation work? If they do work and can it work, or is it just inherently at odds with the open nature of a decentralized social protocol? Yeah, so I think the analogy I would point to is email. Everyone in the world basically uses moderation in their email, they just call it spam filtering. And I don't think it tends to be that controversial because it tends to be pretty tuned to a specific type of email, right? But even if you think about Gmail, Gmail's default interface actually has multiple tabs, right? And if you think about kind of like what gets put in that primary tab, that's effectively Gmail's algorithm, right, and if you're an e-commerce company and you've built a relationship with a user, now Gmail is actually disintermediating you in terms of like the primary place of attention. And so I think that the way to think about moderation with something like Barcaster is going to take time to get multiple clients, right? So we only have one client today, but if you believe that we get to a world where we have multiple clients, then clients are going to be the ones that are the first line of moderation, right? And so our client that we're building might have a different moderation policy than another client in the same way that there is no universal spam filter, it's based on the service provider that you choose. But what's important about that is as an adult and a kind of a consumer, you have the choice of which client to use. And that I think is a good market pressure towards allowing the clients to try to optimize for what they think is the best content moderation policy that still serves their set of customers, right? And I think you can also kind of think about that even if all of the clients decide to kind of restrict access to a certain account, truly reprehensible or terrible content that they're posting. And then if you actually look to the next layer down, the kind of like Farcaster network, there's this concept that we have that are similar to Ethereum nodes called Farcaster hubs. You could have all of the hubs decide to say, hey, we're not gonna index this content. You as that user still have one, your kind of username to pub key mapping, which lives on chain. And then two, you have the ability to go run your own hub, which to use another analogy is very similar to the web, right? If you think about it, when you have a website, Google is not guaranteeing that they're gonna index it. And in fact, if it was really bad, they're probably not going to index it. But that doesn't mean that your website got taken down off of your web host, whether you're hosting it in your basement or paying another web host. But it does shift the distribution significantly in that you have to have a direct relationship with your audience. You're not gonna get kind of free traffic from Google and they'd have to have directly access your website via URL in a browser. And so I think of it like that, where if you remove the vertically integrated stack that exists in traditional social networking, which is identity, the hosting, the moderation and the algorithm, which is essentially distribution, if each one of those is actually kind of a little bit more fragmented and a little bit more market-based, I think you lower the temperature pretty quickly because if you take something like Twitter, fundamentally Twitter's algorithm is optimizing for engagement and time spent. And I would imagine that posts that are incendiary tend to drive engagement. So outside of some manual review, generally those posts are gonna bubble up because it's getting a lot of engagement and people are spending time looking at it. Whereas if now you have an ecosystem of clients, different clients are gonna have different optimizations. And I can tell you the client we intend to build, we're not gonna do an ad-based model, we're gonna do subscription-based models. So you can kind of almost thinking more like superhuman for social media, where our goal is actually to provide the highest signal-to-noise ratio for our subscribers. So that's a fundamentally at odds with time spent. So you could imagine there's like a Zen mode where it's like, don't show me the posts that are gonna actually be abusive or all this other kind of stuff, because we actually aren't trying to get engagement. What we're trying to do is provide you, the subscriber, with the most utility. Yeah, I think that actually speaks to like a very common misconception, which is like, if it's open, it's inherently like chaotic. But I think what you're trying to say is actually the composability of it actually allows for more options and more tailoring that's like suitable to each person, each user or whatever. So I think that's an important misconception actually to dispel. Yeah, and I think one other thing to think about, so I use this analogy, it's not perfect, but newspapers, they have their own editorial policies. What gets put on the front page is essentially an algorithm. It's human powered, right? In theory, they're all reporting on the same factual set of information, the stuff that's happening in the world, but coming at it from a very different lens, right? But because there's actual freedom of choice and anyone can go start their own newspaper, obviously, you need resources to do that. But because that's actually a competitive market, there isn't one algorithm that, oh, well, if it ends up on this newspaper, that's how everyone thinks. There's actually a much bigger marketplace for good and for bad, right? Yeah, so I think a big percentage of our listeners are builders at Web3 companies. So putting out a wishlist, what are some of the things that you wanna see built using the protocol? I think I mentioned it before, I think zero knowledge proofs are this academic, conceptual area that we've seen some major breakthroughs over the last few years in, and they're kind of a technology looking for maybe a solution. But what I think is neat with Forecaster is now you actually have an engaged user base, and hopefully we continue to grow it, that has a public and private key, it's an Ethereum address, and you can actually start to do applications using this kind of theoretical, interesting technology, and it should just be compatible directly with a Forecaster user. And so an example of this would be trustless decentralized polls, where if you think about when you vote on a poll on Twitter, you're actually voting, it's anonymous, but that's only anonymous because Twitter's UI has shown it as anonymous in their database, they know what you voted for. So if that was ever leaked, maybe people would find that embarrassing. Whereas you can imagine with a zero knowledge, trustless decentralized poll, I can prove that I'm an active Forecaster user, I can prove that I only voted once, and I can prove that the original Forecaster account didn't create multiple, you know, kind of sock puppet accounts to do multiple votes. That's a difficult thing to actually go implement, but theoretically that should be able to work with zero knowledge. And so you can imagine an application that now allows for one Forecaster account, one vote, which would be interesting. I think another thing that I'm just generally excited for is today we really only have one client because we've been the one building kind of the protocol and the client. I think early next year, the developer experience at the protocol level is gonna be sufficient enough that you're gonna start to see people experiment with their own clients. And I think that that's really powerful because one, that gives the ability for anyone on our client today that's unhappy with whatever product decisions we make, moderation policy, pick your reason for being upset with us, they now have a viable exit. And I think that's critically important to actually hitting a bar to say, hey, this is a sufficiently decentralized social network, right? Because I can talk to you blue in the face about the philosophy, but if the reality is the only way to access the network in a reasonable way is through one client, if that client decides to kick you off, then effectively the network is no different than a centralized network. So I think it's really important that we get to that ecosystem of multiple clients. And I can imagine some people will build open source, some people will build closed source, subscription, ad-based. I'm just excited that if there's actually starting to be a competing ecosystem of clients, it's going to raise the average quality of client as well as benefit the network in a way that it hits that sufficient decentralization threshold. Yeah, and I'm excited to follow along. Last question is where can people follow the work that you're doing? How to stay tuned if Farcaster opens up and sign up for it? Aside from spamming or DMs? They can send me a DM. I get through them every week. I get through all of them. It's DWR on Twitter. And I think just following the Twitter account, if you're not already in Farcaster or there's a Farcaster Twitter account, if you're not on the network already, it's probably the easiest way to follow the progress. But hopefully we get to a place where we are doing more publishing on Farcaster and less on a centralized social network. But I think from a practical reality, it's where people are already spending time. And if you're spending time on Twitter, you're probably a good candidate to at least check out Farcaster because the experience today at least is very similar. Yeah, yeah. I have to say your response rate is astonishing fast. So ping, DM Dan if you want an invite. Cool. Well, thank you so much for the discussion, Dan.
