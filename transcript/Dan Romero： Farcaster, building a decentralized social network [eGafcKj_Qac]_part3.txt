we're pursuing, one of the most like mind bending products to think about, like if they had actually been successful at hitting some amount of escape velocity, I think you can kind of walk through the idea, as I say, maybe it will never be a consumer use case, but the idea of actually getting everyone to be identified by a public and private key, let alone a cryptocurrency address, just simply a public and private key, I think unlocks a completely different set of experiences that you as a developer can build. And it fundamentally would change the way humans communicate, right? So one easy example, and then encrypted experiences get way easier to manage if you can make some assumptions. Whereas basically the only at scale and encrypted, you have signal, and then you have WhatsApp. And the only reason they did it is kind of one of the co-founders was really passionate about implementing it, which is an amazing achievement. But basically everything else is kind of like done in this surveillance state infrastructure, which is kind of wild if you think about it, especially in a place like the US where we have very strong protections around freedom of speech and privacy. And because we just decided that as a society, reasonable individual choices that convenience trumps kind of some of these core tenants, now basically all of our communication belongs to a bunch of big companies that- It's insane. You have no reasonable expectation of privacy with. And I think if you spend more and more time online, like you should be able to use experiences that aren't clunky, but also give you your kind of like constitutional rights in a variety of different ways. Yeah, it's hard because there's a path dependency to how it develops, right? And the trade-offs that each individual makes at their own level of, I don't wanna use this app that's like hard to use, gonna take like five seconds to load, all that stuff. I mean, even me with Farcaster, like I haven't actually, like I'm just kind of, I'm in the cohort of users who's like converting finally, I feel. And for sure with this conversation. But so the user makes the choice of, I wanna use this thing that's easy to use. And then the net effect of that compounded on itself for five years is that the entire world is using Facebook. And all of our data can be read by Facebook and yeah. And here's the thing, you can either get mad at that or you can just, it's basically a law of human psychology. People are gonna use what's convenient and easy. Like they love free, that's why ad models work. And so you can get mad at that, or you can say, how can I build something competitive with that so that the user looks at it and goes, oh, this feels basically the same. But could potentially have a very different set of underlying principles that again, might not even matter to that user, but they're using it because it's solving a problem or it's providing some utility to them. But all that stuff underneath the hood is abstracted away, but has enabled a whole bunch of other use cases because it's fundamentally built on a protocol and you have these public and private keys that you can actually use as a developer to create new experiences. I think that is what I'm excited about. If we do hit some amount of scale, in many ways it's actually very similar to what Apple does, at least from their marketing standpoint is, and to their credit, I think a lot of their decisions are actually privacy enhancing in a good way. But then it's like, oh, well, we need to increase revenue. So let's build an advertising business and kill everyone else's advertising business. And you asked me not to track, but the Apple can track me unless you go shut it off in this esoteric menu. Right. So it's like, okay, so fine. I don't really have many alternatives, but you can imagine a world where that becomes the kind of base level is norms are around kind of privacy encryption. And then people can compete with that being like a core primitive of what you can do rather than maybe a corporate marketing strategy, which they changed. Like, I feel like the gravitational pull of the other or the existing model is so strong, both from a, you're an entrepreneur, developer, you're building something or from the user's point of view and like the ripple effects that these things have in the shape of the world and society over time. And what's crazy to me is one, how it comes down to nuanced product decisions and like concrete execution right now, and like onboarding these users and getting something that works. Like Keybase didn't work because of slight things about their model. It's not enough if you believe this is a better world, you have to actually like out execute the other people who are running downhill. And because the other way is easier, it also requires a founding team and early people who are working on it, who actually hold these beliefs truly, right? And are principled about it because the other, like there's just so many off ramps where you can sacrifice them in some way. And this is the same thing that I've always admired about Vitalik, for example, right? Like Ethereum has like the staunch, like, no, we're building this decentralized infrastructure that could be like a protocol that much of the world taps into in the future. You can't be kind of optimizing for short-term wins or personal financial gain, even though like those things will also happen naturally as a by-product. But it's almost wild how I feel like if you ran multiple, you know, simulations of the world, like if there was a Monte Carlo simulation of the world, like the world where something like this actually exists and takes hold is maybe a rare one. But then once it does like get past a certain point, it's like so strong and robust because it's gonna suck in all the liquidity. It's gonna be something everyone trusts, like can't be rugged. It's very interesting in that way. And I feel like, I mean, just even thinking about that, I feel like in the journey of Farcaster, there will probably be this inflection point, right? Where it switches to, okay, now this is the credibly neutral, you know, communications protocol of the web. And if it succeeds and then it starts just like out competing everyone else much, much more easily. So two things there, one, I think Ethereum and Vitalik are deeply influential on how Varun and I think about this. And there's a reason we're using Ethereum L1, despite people saying, oh, the gas costs are this or that. I think for the identity primitive that makes Forecaster work outside of what's off chain, we couldn't think of a better network to go put it on. And I actually think optimizing for cheaper transactions per second or any of that stuff is, especially if your architecture actually doesn't need most of the stuff on chain, you only need to do it once, what better chain to go put it on because it's actually capturing a lot of how we approach things as this pragmatic approach to building, but also a deep philosophical belief in decentralization. And I know there are plenty of people who wanna criticize Ethereum for not being decentralized, not gonna convince those people. But I think for us, building on that infrastructure, like that's the same thing that we wanna achieve for our own protocol is that we want people to deeply believe that they're doing this because they actually want this to hit a level of scale and credible neutrality, similar to Ethereum. The thing is, is like, will it work or not? I'm not sure, but we control our own destiny in the sense that we don't have to rely on anyone else. We don't have to convince anyone else other than the users to use the protocol because we've built our own client. And if we can continue to grow the number of people who wanna show up every day, have conversations, even if it's just one client, we do that for two or three years, and then people start to get interested in building on top of it because we've hit some sufficient number of people building. I think that's totally fine. Like, I think that's a reasonable path and people might criticize, oh, well, you didn't really have a thriving protocol until then. But I think what matters is, does the protocol have actual people using it? And like, do I actually wanna build a product or service that go after those people? I think that's it. And so I think just take the time preference of saying, like, this is what I wanna go do and be willing to realize that it's gonna take a long time. You know, easier said than done, but I think for what we were optimizing for, going back to working on a problem for a really long time and having a clear goal of like, where we wanna head this, right? Like, there is no version of selling this to Facebook or Coinbase or whatever. It's the protocol should outlast any company if it is successful. And so I think one analogy here is when the internet happened in the 90s, AOL in the US was this huge platform in terms of getting people online, but AOL in the early days didn't have support for the internet. The internet was purely an academic thing. And then Mosaic came out and then people had other providers that would provide access to the internet. And then eventually AOL added the support from instead of just having this closed network, you could actually go use the open network. And I think that the point you bring up of there will be an inflection point if it's successful, where because the amount of kind of innovation that's starting to happen on this open ecosystem and the kind of ability for anyone to go build a business and not have to worry about gatekeepers over here, I do think has a shot of happening, but I would suspect that it's going to be a while. And I think having the mentality that you just know it, it's like, all right, there's probably another year or another two years or three years before that happens, helps you manage through the cycles of the ups and downs because you don't expect it to happen tomorrow. And it's not gonna be like this sudden, magic inflection point as much as it kind of flips. And then that in itself starts to be a compounding curve. And so if you actually just think through, whether it's an S curve or like exponential growth, you realize these things go for a very long time where they're small, if it's actually on a curve and it's just hard to know where you are on that curve. Right, right. One of the things I was gonna ask about is in relation to competition. So we talked about, yeah, how strategically you're competing with these existing social networks, but I'm curious more as an operator and the person who's doing this, right? From a personal, like emotional point of view, how do you think about the notion of competition? How do you relate to it? And I imagine like one of the things I was kind of trying to put myself in your shoes was seeing all of this stuff happen with Elon Musk and Twitter, right? Who is like one of the most formidable, like the most formidable entrepreneur of our time has bought this company. I think it's going through, is like letting go of 75% of the people supposedly. So it's a new kind of like force that's entering this dynamic that has a lot of moving parts already. And part of what I've taken away from what you've said, which resonates with me too, is if you're really just focused on your own, if you really believe in what you're doing and you have a long-term point of view and you're in control of your own destiny in some ways, right, you can just kind of shut all of that out. But I'm curious just also you having been someone who's, you know, was at Coinbase through all these years and just as a person who's doing this right now, how do you think about these things and what can you share about that? So I think I learned a few things at Coinbase. One, and I think people don't appreciate this from the web two element because Coinbase is very much a Silicon Valley company and, you know, big in the sense that it has a lot of users. Coinbase doesn't have a network effect. Coinbase is a brand, a brand that people trust. There's convenience. There's, you know, a lot of features, you know, payment methods, all the countries that it serves. But you can buy the same Ether, Bitcoin at a competitor and probably for a cheaper fee. And so for the 10 plus years, people have been saying, oh, Coinbase fee compression. The only thing Coinbase has done is double prices. Like in 2016, it went from 1% to 2%. And everyone said, oh, you're gonna have all this fee compression. And you might even look at their public financials and say, oh, look, the average fee is going down. It's actually just because the institutional volume is increasing and so that's cheaper. And so it's a mixed thing. Prices probably come down over time, but fundamentally Coinbase actually is much more akin to what at least initially drove a lot of what people picked Apple for in the sense that they, there was a brand, it was kind of a set of decisions. If you did every feature, you know, the classic example is the iPod compared to some other MP3 player. If you're just strictly doing it on storage functionality, it's something better. But I think Ben Thompson's talked quite a bit about this of like the thing that a lot of the kind of analysts when they do everything data-driven miss is taste and consumer preference. And the idea that like people like things that they can resonate with. And I wouldn't actually say Coinbase has that level of love that compared to something like Apple. But I think actually what people underrate is most people who get into crypto don't wanna have a hardware wallet. They don't wanna use a controlled wallet. They actually just want something that feels safe. And the reality is that for a lot of people, Coinbase just is super easy and it makes them feel safe. And the company has taken security really seriously. And I think that that's paid off for them. So shifting over to kind of thinking about that for Forecaster, the reality is I think the network effect, A, if the protocol is successful, it's actually you've commoditized the network effect. You've said the network kind of is a neutral ground and anyone can kind of tap into it. And so as we think about building our client, our client is very much, assuming we actually follow through and don't do things that are adding features that create kind of lock-in. But I think the reality for our client is it's always going to be based on do consumers or if we do a subscription model, do our subscribers, do they find value in this client? Like, are we adding the features that people actually want and providing some amount of value to them to actually use it every day? Otherwise they're gonna switch to something that's better, right? And so I think that that's like a mentality that a lot of web-to-marketplace companies or with network effects think that they have, but the reality is they can get very far off of just taking the same kind of network effect with proprietary liquidity and run for a really long time. The one I love to point out is Airbnb. Amazing design product is I think generally really great and stand at plenty of Airbnbs. But the fact that people complain about this cleaning fee and they have made this decision, AB testing or conversion rate that, no, we're gonna hide the cleaning fee until the end. If there was a real, I think marketplace out there of like, assume Airbnb was a protocol. That as a client, I don't think would cut it. And so they're able to kind of exist on the fact that the way that that model is structured and they did a lot of hard work to build that proprietary liquidity, but it isn't a protocol mindset. And so I think that that's like one thing that is from Coinbase that we very much resonate with is that we're only as good as like, what's the last feature we shipped or what value are we providing to our customers? I think the second thing on competitors, and this is a little bit more of a philosophical point, but I very much believe in Paul Graham's philosophy and it's a little crude, but you're more likely to die as a startup from suicide, not homicide. And I think it's a little bit of a Hollywood version of startups where you're in the arena competing with others and it's like the competitor launches a product and you got to follow and that's how people think. And I think that the reality is all people think that their competitors are out executing them or they're perfectly polished when the reality is if you know anything about a startup, they're pretty chaotic inside. And I think that if you spend too much time worrying about competitors versus just if you have users, like what are your users want? And a really simple example of this is every so often on Forecaster, I just say product annoyances, like go at it, like tell me all the things that you can't stand about the client. And if I was worried about like what competitors are launching, I could like go build a product strategy based on like trying to compete there versus just asking that simple question and getting a hundred responses. And then you kind of realize like, oh shit, like there's a lot of stuff that we can just improve with our own thing, let alone any new features. I think that is a lot more of the type of thinking that people should be orienting towards. It's interesting talking about that on Forecaster is like the extreme version of tell people about your idea, they're not gonna steal it, they're gonna give you good feedback, but you're literally posting it publicly for all potential competitors to come and see the list of your deficiencies and what they can do and all of that. Yeah, if you're not intellectually honest with that and you can't actually even let your competitors look at it, I think it's gonna be very hard for you to win, especially with software, right? Like other industries might have slightly different models, but the industry I know is like internet software. And I think that the kind of like, look, all our metrics are public, all our competitors, like in the web two sense or web three sense, their metrics are public, web two, they're public. So you get a sense. So in some ways, it's like everyone kind of knows all the dirty laundry that exists. And the thing I think you're like, instead of spending time on your competitors, I think what you should actually be focused on is, again, another Paul Graham, build something people want. And so for us, it was, and another thing he said, is you're gonna find a hundred people who love your product then a thousand people or 10,000 people like it. So much wisdom in that. Yeah, I think like any entrepreneur who is building something new, Paul Graham is like, that's the zero to one Bible in my view, because it helps you get the right mindset. And a lot of them sound trite, but the reality is I think that they are the correct points of view, hard to follow. Because sometimes when you're going through a day to day of the emotional rollercoaster that can, you know, it's like, okay, I don't need any more trite advice from Paul Graham, but if you actually step back and remove some of the emotion from it, it's probably right. And I think the miss is people tend to think that like doing a startup is like this kind of like strategy chess thing that you're thinking about competitors and where to kind of, that is much more at the one to 10 or frankly, 10 to a hundred scale that now you have like big, big groups of people and it's like, okay, where do you direct them? Whereas as an early stage startup, it's just, you wanna be as close to the metal as possible, which is what are your users saying? How are they feeling? And so it's, you know, talk to users, find people who absolutely love the product, double down on what seems to be working there. Hopefully you don't end up at a local maximum, but like overall your competitors are not gonna be the way to kind of like find the unlock. It's actually in your community of users. And so I think people overrated. They also don't know what they're doing and you've got as good of an intuition or better one with the users that you have and what they love. Yeah, I would actually say it's, you start worrying about your competitors, you're starting to let them drive your product roadmap, which if you have good intuition, now you're actually imported someone else's intuition, which you don't know if that's actually good or not. And yeah, there can be some growth numbers that look exciting, but if you're not confident even enough, like the point, like why did you even start working on the...
