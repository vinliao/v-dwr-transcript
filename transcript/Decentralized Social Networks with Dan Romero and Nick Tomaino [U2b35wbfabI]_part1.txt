Hey, how's it going? Good to see you. How are you? Good to see you. Cool. So many of you guys know that Dan and I work together at Coinbase. I always said when we worked together that I thought Dan would be one of the most successful people post Coinbase. And then when he learned that he was building a product that really resonated with me and I started using it and loved it was kind of a no brainer for us to invest. Dan, why don't we start. What was your biggest lesson from Coinbase that kind of has helped you navigate Farcaster and really, you know, you base your building Farcaster on, if anything? The one thing that Coinbase did really well and I learned there and continues to do well today is a sense of pragmatism in a space that is, or can be pretty ideological. You know, when we were working back at Coinbase in 2014, we were Bitcoin only. And I think there's kind of a very hardcore culture within Bitcoin of, you know, not your keys, not your coins and Coinbase is evil. And it's kind of disheartening if you spend too much time like reading Twitter or things like that, or talking to like hardcore crypto people to have them be kind of saying what you're doing isn't real crypto or, you know, is in kind of antithesis to the core values of the community. And then kind of over the five years I was there, you know, we onboarded 100 plus million people into crypto and the kind of primary on ramp for most people getting into crypto for the first time. And then you kind of quickly realize that it's easy to be ideological and have opinions on Twitter. It's extremely difficult to build an at scale financial services company that follows the regulatory regime, right? And the stuff that FTX was doing, while at the same time still actually providing kind of fundamentally new technology and kind of innovation. So I think something I deeply respect about Brian's ability to kind of like continue on the kind of like path towards this being this mission driven company of like building in crypto and not getting distracted with things like blockchain. But at the same time, realizing, hey, we, we need to follow the regulations like this isn't kind of like Uber or Airbnb where, you know, a local taxi regulator or kind of housing authority can kind of give you a slap in the wrist like you get on the wrong side of Treasury or the DOJ you go to jail. And I think that that balance of kind of wanting to move forward while at the same time knowing what rules that are like kind of non negotiable and also just relative to the ideology in the space, and just like the fundamental UX and and pragmatism like building an app that people can use. I think that that is very much internalized for me as I've approached Forecaster. Yeah, I like to call it the intersection of purists and tourists I talked about it a little bit early but you know the purists are the you know the Bitcoin maxis or the kind of deep ideologues and the tourists are, you know, you could debate about who exactly is who maybe, you know, FTX, Solana, things like that and I think really kind of want to be at the intersection right and that's obviously, you know what you're trying to do at Forecaster. So, decentralized social has kind of become a big narrative in the last year or two, right, and there's a lot of, you know, new products popping up. Forecaster is one of them. One of the unique things about your approach is you've kept Forecaster gated for the past year, really year plus I think. And that's at a time when you know you have all these people that want to leave Twitter. There's more and more talk about, you know, decentralized social so why, you know, take that approach of keeping it gated versus kind of trying to capitalize on the, the interest in decentralized social. Yeah, so two, two ways to think about it. So the first is we started working on this in 2020, when I originally remember telling some of the people who were kind of interested in what I was working on next. And people kind of looked at me, being like that's kind of complete waste of your time like what are you, what are you thinking. You're going to get kicked off Twitter like it was just kind of like the only people who need an alternative to Twitter are kind of like this deplorable set of kind of political folks and like, you know, what are you even spending your time, you're just going to get a parlor gap. That's what you're going to do. Fast forward to, you know, Trump getting kicked off which, again, I think most people on the left side of the political spectrum and like okay that seems reasonable to then Elon acquiring Twitter and then quickly the same people going wait a second like we shouldn't have one individual controlling a social network like this. I think things have gotten. It's like trendy to say oh like look, you know protocol based social networks or decentralized social networks. It's their moment right mass it on and all these other things. Our opinion, going back to the fact that we were predating this trend is the best social network in history in terms of total daily active users it's Facebook still growing they just think I think hit like 3 billion daily active users or something. They were gated for two and a half years, you could not sign up on Facebook if you wanted. You could get a.edu email address which is some version of kind of quality gating for the first two and a half years. And so, if it worked for Facebook, why wouldn't it work for a new social network and I think that there's this kind of mean that happened in the last, I like to call it a zero interest rate phenomenon plus the the S curve for mobile is social networks grow virally and just kind of you have this explosive growth overnight and it's kind of an overnight success, whereas I think most important things and things that last just are kind of like slow but but consistent compounding. And so that that was that was our original strategy and so when when things changed in the fall and people saying hey like this is the moment for decentralized social wiring you opening up the floodgates. The, the second framework that we kind of applied to that to say okay should we revisit this this core tenant of our strategy of keeping things gated and just kind of consistent compounding and growth is the, the framework of stated versus revealed preference, which has been pretty brutal in terms of building a product in the space of my initial set of people that I went after for Forecaster, we're all my kind of like crypto friends who've been talking about the need for decentralized social and talking a big game on Twitter about how we needed this. And so we go and build the first version. I on board them over zoom. They are kind of excited about it and then they use it for that day and then they don't come back, and I think that's the stated preference on Twitter is that they care about the stuff the reveal preferences, they have, you know, 500,000 followers on Twitter and they've spent 10 years building that audience. They're not going to give that away tomorrow. So even if they kind of like want to talk about the merits of decentralization, using a new decentralized product, even if it's if it's halfway decent is not actually optimizing for the thing that the reveal preferences is what they care about is is reaching audience. And so, my, our thought is that this data versus reveal preference. This is not going to change right now, like so if you if you're complaining about Twitter, for whatever reason, and you're saying you're going to mass it on, if you've seen the data, like, you know, in the fall people were saying you're crazy why aren't you opening it up, mass it on I think it had a 60% correction in there. By the way, they're calling monthly active users which is not how Facebook measures their social network daily active users is the actual liquidity of a social network, and no one wants to serve daily active users because daily activities is a really really hard number to grow. And those numbers are down. And so the stated preferences Twitter sucks I'm leaving Twitter, you announce it on Twitter, by the way, you don't say that on Macedon, and then you go use Macedon for a few weeks and then you come back to Twitter and so I think we're back at the same place where there are no shortcuts to building something that's valuable. And I think, in our view, I would rather focus on what I would call forecaster natives people who don't already have a lot of accrued social capital on Twitter, but are willing to do the proof of work into a new social network, where they're they're contributing to the conversation liquidity and things like that. And I think that's the foundation that we want to be able to grow from. And so far that that strategies worked out pretty well, right, it took us a really really long time to hit what I would think of as like that kind of first order of magnitude of conversation liquidity where you open up the app. So the app is like Twitter, and there would be new posts, other than for me. And so once we hit that point, what was interesting is the secondary effect of that is now people started to want to tinker with the permissionless APS. And so that that kind of back and forth is the thing that we're maniacally focused on is continue to grow daily active users retain daily active users that are using the product, which is going to encourage people to start building more apps, more apps, more users and that's the kind of ping pong for the social network and I think the last thing is, to, you know, there are not that many examples of people trying to build both a social network and a protocol at the same time, actually mass it on is probably the only other example, and they've been working for, you know, five years and only had a little bit of growth recently based on this kind of Elon stuff, and even that it was actually temporary. So, my view is rooms not built in a day, and anyone who's trying to think that that's going to happen. They're not thinking on a long enough term mindset. Yeah. And the way I think you're getting is also kind of unique it's like you're not getting like Facebook did, where it's, you know, just people at Harvard or just Ivy League schools to start or whatever you're kind of curating the community really yourself, aren't you're still kind of talking to pretty much every user that comes on and it's all kind of through you. I think, and to me that has been a really good strategy because the feed is really unique and forecaster it's like it's very different than my Twitter feed where it's all about the current thing and, you know, whether if FT x the current thing everything on Twitter is FT x and forecaster there's no FT x it's it's it's kind of unique, kind of, like you said forecaster natives that are talking about different things, they talk a little bit or just how you you've gated. Yeah, so I'm a big believer in programs, do things that don't scale, like at each part of the startup, there's probably a new thing you can kind of fake it till you make it and manually do something longer than you think. And so we're about 8000 people in the beta. I onboarded the first 400 manually, so like a 1530 minute zoom call like this walking through got a really good understanding of the user experience. And so I think we've been able to polish that pretty well and anecdotally I think the feedback is like this is as good as any web three onboarding. But I think the, the next stage, I had to shift from I can't do every individual onboarding. And so what I did is I shifted it to my Twitter DM inbox, we experimented with a couple different things but this one worked because one, you're a good candidate if you're already active on Twitter like like the reveal preferences if you're if you're tweeting and using that network in a good way, you're probably most likely to, you know, convert in a good way for forecaster versus if you've never used Twitter, like jumping into forecaster right away, probably low like that you're going to retain the second thing also, which is, I think underrated is I have a direct line of communication to every single one of the users on forecaster in an app that even if they stop using forecaster or gets uninstalled from their phone. I have high confidence they probably still have Twitter. And so the ability to DM. Basically, any churned user and ask for feedback has been really helpful from a product standpoint, and one nice thing is there's some friction right you have to DM me to get on forecaster I have to kind of take a quick look at your profile say sure I invite you. But because of that kind of initial connection. I've had like a really really high hit rate to be able to reach out to anyone and they're willing to give me, you know, two messages worth of feedback. And so over the last two years, the aggregate amount of feedback from churned users who usually if you were to send them an email survey they're never going to fill that out it's kind of loaded in their inbox versus a direct message from someone that they already previously messaged with is a bit of a hack just in terms of attention. And so I think that that's really been informative for just how we've iterated on the product. And so we're getting to the end of this like I were about to launch kind of user driven invites but I think a lot of the lessons that I've learned both in the kind of like how to make sure onboarding is really smooth, if I'm not there to help people, as well as the, the kind of customer user feedback side of things I think we're going to build into our invite process that that's driven by users. Yeah, that's smart. Yeah, I've had a bunch of LPS have asked for invites. Over the months, and there was a link at one point but I think what I've been saying now is just dm. Yeah, and if anyone's listening, if you send a dm to me on Twitter I'm DWR three letters, and just put the word Indiana in there. I got a lot of spam inbound so by using those keywords it just bubbles it up to the top and then I can make sure you get an invite right after this. Sweet. One thing I'm curious about how does the feed work to me, the feed is one of the most important, if not the most important kind of issues around social networks right now, and especially with Twitter. I mean, Twitter seems to have gone back to this kind of algorithmic feed, it's really hard to use chronological is not default. And it's, it's even confusing for me, like, I think, being transparent about the feed and the way the feed works is like an important way for a new social network to differentiate and just to provide a better service to users. Right now though, even I have the same question about the forecaster feed like I'm, it's not clear to me how it works. So, maybe, how does it work. Do you plan to be transparent about that or do you plan to be more so talk a little bit about that. Yeah, so fortunate thing for me is I'm a 15 plus year Twitter power user so I strong opinions on the Twitter products so when I got to build my own feed. One, I think I have a generally a pretty high quality bar so wanted to say something that I would be happy with. In general, I think people have been overall pretty happy. The default to start with reverse chronological. So here's the challenge with that so one for a power user that's great, you have full control, you kind of understand the German mystic I post, like, and I'm following you, it's going to be at the top of the feed, there was no mucking around things. The reveal preference though is consumers like algorithmic feeds, if they're good. Obviously, Tick Tock is a great example of this where you don't even have a follow model for the most part for most users and it's just an endless stream of, you know, ups and downs based on your reveal preference on how long you watch those videos. So, I think where we have been really kind of focused initially is keep the initial feed, because the types of people who are signing up right now are power users, so that they're going to bias towards wanting if I follow user that's what I want to see the content and I want to see other content, the two things that we will obviously one, we have a concept of like a retweet, so recast so if someone I'm following recast that's that's one way you get content outside of who you're directly following. And the second thing that we've been a little bit more aggressive compared to something like Twitter is we're really focused on conversations, and my view is Twitter, Twitter is at its worst. When people are using Twitter as a broadcast platform, and really don't care about any of the engagement they're just strictly trying to drive eyeballs to whatever podcast video website, they're not actually using Twitter as a conversational platform they're strictly using it as a one way broadcast platform. So, what we wanted to optimize for is the, the conversations that are actually having other people responding. And so the simplest thing is anytime someone replies to a conversation on forecaster in the core feed and assuming you're following those people that gets bumped up to the top. So inevitably if there's, there's an active conversation that that that kind of unit of kind of cast tweets, effectively, will sit at the top of your feed all day. And so it's just kind of, that's, that's, that's the way the algorithm works. And what's great is is actually the number of average replies to a cast compared to like even a sampling of tweets for myself is way higher. And also, that is actually informed our recommendation algorithms where this is the first time we're using machine learning, who to follow. And then we actually have this feed called highlights which is more like a tick tock where we're just trying to surface the data, but we've been explicit in making it focused on the most active conversations versus something that I don't know is like a joke, it gets a ton of likes but no one is no one is actually really going back and forth on that. Here's the important thing though, because forecaster is an actual protocol, and we'll have permissionless access to the underlying data and API's, you are going to have dozens of clients and dozens of different algorithms and approaches. That can suit different consumer preferences. And I think that's actually one of the motivating things for me to be working on this is, I don't claim to have the perfect algorithm. And I think that, you know, consumer preferences are very varied and diverse and yes there may be a couple of dominant ones, but that's okay to have like a long tail of kind of more niche products. And I think, just imagine, for example, if email was essentially administered spam algorithm. You know how like quickly that would get captured by whatever group of people and then they would decide oh well this is not spam but this, this content shouldn't make it to the like front of email algorithms. We don't have that we have a market based solution where Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, and a whole long tail are out there. And so actually what you get is you get much better behavior it's really really honed in on what is what is a consumer actually want versus, oh we have this kind of like monopoly on on the content moderation. How can we actually go use this for for what other pets, and so so for me that the imperative here is actually not build the best algorithm, although we want to have as good of an algorithm as we can in our client, it's actually more about get to a place where we can work with thousands of other clients with other algorithms that can suit different consumer preferences. Have you. Is there a way to see like exactly the way the algorithm works, either in the app or have you written about this or anything yet. No, it's a good push. I think the following algorithm is extremely simple there's no machine learning, it's just like the only time you'll see things that people that you're not following in a reverse chronological order are recast. And so indeed, that is a kind of like proto ml headed in the direction of kind of more of like a tick tock type thing.
