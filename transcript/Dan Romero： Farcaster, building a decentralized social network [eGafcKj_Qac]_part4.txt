thing in the first place, if basically what you're doing is looking at another thing and saying, oh, well, they're doing this, we should do this too. Now, asterisk, sometimes someone actually unlocks fundamentally something new, and it's probably useful to know what other people are doing. But outside of a rare instance, I don't actually think, and in that case, even if you try to go copy it, it's unlikely if someone gets this breakthrough thing, product, strategy, whatever, that somehow you're going to copy it and then out execute them on the thing that they already have the insight. And so I think, you know, call it whatever percentage of time people spend thinking about competitors, it probably should be a 10th of the time, if not, you know, even lower. And then that extra time can go back to thinking about your community, your users, your product, your protocol. Totally. And, and then the, the kind of mirror to this question is with this mindset of everything's open, we're going to talk about things openly. It relies on an ability, like in a, in a knowledge that you can execute and you can, you can move really fast and you can, you can actually like ship the things you're going to do. And on this point, you're actively hiring kind of like staff, you know, engineers and you're keeping the team very lean and this is, you know, this is not what everyone does. There's people who just go hire like 50 people immediately as soon as they raise money. So how do you think about the team architecture and how that reflects into how you're operating and building what you're building? So Varun and I both worked at Coinbase. I was employee 20 and you know, I think Varun was around play 50. We saw a thousand plus people get hired. And I can tell you from my experience is when we were a thousand people, I don't think we were moving any faster than we were when we were 50 and I think there's a variety of reasons for that, but, but fundamentally adding more people adds more complexity to doing anything with a group. That's why I think generally great things are achieved with much smaller groups of people, like in terms of like great creative output, because managing a large group of people, you know, the, the top of the pyramid talking down to the bottom, it just kind of doesn't work. And so I think where we're approaching this from is we still have a lot of stuff to figure out both at the protocol level, but also the product level. And having a large organization means I'm outsourcing a lot of those decisions to people who have been, you know, they might be smart, but they just have been working and thinking less about this problem than I have. And I think that like, you, you can tell like Forecaster, like it's very deliberate in the sense it's like every decision that we've made in the app was made by me, but also by Varun and the team's input, right? Like there, there it's, it's actually multiple people at the same time. Multiple people who have kind of like really put an imprint on it versus I think in a larger organization, you end up getting a lot of individuals make decisions and then it kind of like filters up. And I think that the other general point of view is I think most companies just hire people because that's what other companies do. It's not a first principles approach. So example, Instagram got to 27 million users, I think more or less with 13 people in 2012, arguably one of the most successful products of ever. If not, you know, any type of software network period. I mean, it's basically where all Facebook's value comes from today, like in terms of the growth and like monetization. And so that happened in 2012 and we're in 2022 and you're not saying 10 years of developer productivity, like with all of these cloud services and tools and, and, you know, improvements that you can't go build a social app with that many users with that few people and, and, and the other example is I think WhatsApp and there was a viral tweet today, JD Ross, who's the co-founder of Royal had it, Elon responded to this by the way, so he, he brought up the fact that WhatsApp had 35 engineers with 450 million users, that's more than Twitter. And so Twitter has 7,000 plus people today. They're talking about doing a 75% reduction. Look, anyone losing their job, like that sucks. Like you, you know, you've got bills to pay, et cetera. But just if you take the abstract of going from 7,000 people to 2,000 people and WhatsApp again, almost a decade ago was at 450 million people with potentially way higher daily active usage in terms of what you're kind of sending around. That that's, that's an insane ratio. And I think the last point specifically out of crypto Coinbase got up to 6,000 people last year, FTX is 200, maybe, maybe a little higher, roughly the same trading volume and yeah, there's other things like Coinbase has a hundred million consumers and like, there's a lot more there in the U S there's regular. But I can promise you that if one has 200 and you have 6,000 and you're doing roughly the same volume, the one that has 6,000 has too many people. And so I think just if you, if you approach it like that, you, you should be really, really hesitant to add headcount if you don't need it, because what you're doing is you're, you're decreasing the ability for your organization to move fast because you're adding overhead and some businesses are going to need that. Right? Like if you have an operations heavy business, like a business like DoorDash or like, yeah, of course you're going to need to do that. But in a case of building a protocol, like if you actually build it correctly and then you have this client that's on top of it, you should be able to get a lot of leverage and scale with software and these tools and the, the, the other examples I'll give you is I don't think Uniswap was that many people for all the volume that's gone through Uniswap and then, and then OpenSea even, right? Like, yeah, OpenSea last year had to end up hiring a lot of people, very similar to Coinbase in 2017, but they hired a bunch of people and now volumes have come back down. So in some ways, like in hindsight, 2020, you might not have hired as many people because they, I think they had to do a layout. So it's this, you, if you, if you think about the systems that you want to design upfront, you have senior people who actually know how to build those systems rather than build a system that works today and then has to be replaced two or three times along the way. I think you can get a lot of leverage with a really small team. Yeah. And frankly, it's just more fun, right? Like Jeff Bezos has this concept, two pizza teams. Like there's, there's kind of like a fun aspect of like, we, we had the team on site, everyone's remote a couple of weeks ago and we had a night where we just played out a board game, terraforming Mars. There are only six of us or, you know, and so it, like, that's pretty magical when the group of people that's working on something that hopefully ends up being a scale, can sit around a table and play board game and, you know, have two pizzas. And so I think like for us, like getting much bigger in this early stage where we don't know if we've actually figured it out, it's just, you're, you're cargo-culting Google, which is what I think most startup things in Silicon Valley look at Google, which is the best business model of all time. And they go, oh, well, we should offer these perks and we should do this and that and that, and it's like, yeah, well, if you have a search engine that kicks off a hundred billion dollars a year, I would offer these things too. And have all these, you know, moonshots and venture firms and all this other kinds of stuff. Whereas the reality is most businesses aren't like that. So maybe it'd be a little bit more judicious in hiring. And does that, does that flip at some point? Like when you get it to a particular scale, does the mindset shift? I mean, I could, I could see it also not if FTX is an example, and I don't see from first principles reasoning why you need to get to like thousands of people. Hey, look, like I grew up on the operations and BD side at Coinbase. I don't have any interest in hiring a BD person. I have very good friends who are, you know, business development people. Like, I don't, I don't see it adding a ton of value. I know people talk a lot about BD and like crypto and like telling you it really like users don't really care. So that's like a whole function you don't need. Yeah. I think you can be really smart about finance, like in terms of just like building out, you know, I think one other thing that we've done is like most of our stuff is off chain. So we don't need to deal with all these like money transmitter licenses and all the other stuff that's something like Coinbase. So, so being deliberate in terms of what you're doing on the technical side of things can actually flow through with the shape of your organization. But, but yeah, look, if you had 10 million daily active users, like you need, you need an operations team to help with the customer support side of things. Believe me, I felt that at Coinbase, public failures of not scaling customer support fast enough. Right. I think you, you're going to need the ability to handle like a DMCA notice. And it's like, yeah, it's a decentralized network, but your client actually is a company. So you need to comply, like all of that stuff happens, but doesn't happen for a while, and I think part of where we need to focus is not building like the infrastructure for a thing that might happen, it's actually make that thing happen, and if you're a little bit more experienced and get a little lucky, you can kind of start to sense that that's the trajectory is actually happening. And then you can actually start to hire those people in. And I think I'm fortunate in the sense that I had to do that on the fly. Coinbase, and there were a lot of failures associated with that, but I think if that we were fortunate enough to have that happen again, I think I would be able to kind of execute on that a lot better. Cause I had already done it. And it's a, it's a, it's in some ways a better problem to have than a bloated team that's ahead of the problems it's trying to solve to like get hit in the face with like a ton of work and everyone just has to like do work 24 hours a day. Until you can catch up. Yeah, I think, uh, another interesting thing that I associate with these headcount numbers is it's pre COVID Silicon Valley culture where people really don't talk about revenue and metrics. Like it's kind of this, this thing where you, that it's weird. People will talk about how much they raise and have the valuation. Cause that now became public thing used to not be. And now people don't talk about revenue or profitability or metrics while they're a private company. So the proxy to measure your progress is to tell the startup parties what your most recent round was. So it's like, Oh, look at these fancy investors telling me that it's worth this on paper. And then how many people, how many, Oh yeah, we're a hundred now. Like, Oh, that sounds impressive compared to a two or three person startup. What I think is more interesting is like, no, no, we're, we're 12. Yeah. We have got 10 million active users. Like that, that, that's a lot. Yeah, the active users, like that, that you don't hear that, right? Like you hear plenty of companies that are a hundred people. So I think, I think it's just a norm thing. And I think Silicon Valley late stage zero interest rate policy, money is cheap. Like that was the culture. Yeah. It's interesting that, you know, these are people who the role should have self-selected for people with conviction, with an ability to think, you know, outside of the herd mentality and these sorts of things still happen. One other question that came up, cause I'm very curious to hear how you think is remote. Why are you building the team remote? And how do you think about that? So there's a practical reason and then the philosophical reason. So the practical reason is I'm in LA. My, we moved down here to LA from SF after 10 years there during COVID, my wife got a job at SpaceX, liked it. So we're going to stay. And my co-founder Varun moved down. So the two of us are actually here. We work in the office every day, sitting next to each other. It's like a garage. And we could do the model where we actually say, Hey, you need to move and co-locate. But I think the reality is LA, despite being a large city, and there are definitely talented engineers here. The pool of senior engineers in LA is going to be way smaller. Then somewhere like the Bay area. So we could either move back to the Bay area or we can say, Hey, let's, let's build remote. And I think that the thing that works for remote in my view is if you hire senior people, they, by definition need less management. Like they're more experienced. Like if you say, Hey, we're trying to accomplish X week over week, they're actually good enough to push back up front. Like, Hey, that's too much work for this week. And you actually can trust that judgment. And then assuming you kind of scope something correctly, you can give them that work and they need minimal input. You know, there's instances where you're brainstorming, but they get the work done week over week. I think a more junior person and junior people are my favorite people to work with in the sense that they just tend to have a lot more energy. They're earlier in their career. They're hungry to learn. That's not to say more experienced people don't have it, but on the average. Those people actually, I think need to be in office. And my view is I think you learn a lot by kind of osmosis being around people. And like I went through that experience for the first time. Years of my career where, you know, in an office, like being around other people. And so I think that if we do start hiring more junior people, we're going to have a very kind of focused in office culture here in LA, because I think that that will be the best way for those people to get. Maximum amount of learning and also their effort, which they tend to be very high energy, high effort. Can kind of be channeled in the right way to get the most efficiency out of. And so that's our general approach is we're going to hire remote for senior and then for and engineers and designers. Like I don't think operations people generally should be remote. Like I think they should be in person. Like I grew up on that side of the business. So and then I think that the last point is, and we may change this over time, but we're pretty strongly in favor of keeping the time zones to North America. We're here on the West Coast. Our view is like plus three minus three, which there's really not much minus three. Hawaii, I think would qualify, but that's it. That's all we do. Because even if people tell you that they can work those hours, it's really inconvenient when it's three o'clock in LA and you ping your colleague in New York. And they say they're working those hours, but the reality is their kids are home from school. Like now they want to be having dinner and the two o'clock or three o'clock people on in the West Coast, they're like, hey, like we want to actually get this resolved now. And so I think getting farther outside that just gets that much more challenging. And so I think we're willing to compromise with like East Coast to West Coast, but not much else. Yeah. Awesome, man. Well, I know we're coming to the end. So I thought we would close with more of a fun question, which I think will still be instructive for me, which is, this actually came to mind reading some of Varun's casts, where he recently did this AMA and someone said, Varun is the dark horse comedian of Farcaster. And he said that you basically force him to do five Joe casts a day as an engagement metric. And the question there is maybe related to that, but prompted by that, which is if you're talking with someone who's thoughtful, has things they're thinking about in their head, but is not effective at using Farcaster or Twitter or like social media in general, what are the things you tell that person, whether it's Varun or me or anyone else? Yeah. So to clarify, that is a joke from Varun. I do not require. He's actually a pretty funny guy. I think the... It would be a good like KPI, like dashboard. Look, I think naturally, people have asked me this, oh, you should just hire a community manager and have them do the community stuff. And that way you can free your time up. And I view that as like antithetical. I'm trying to build a social network. Like if I'm not the most active user or close to one of the most active users, then clearly we're doing something wrong. So you kind of need to actually teach people how to use social media. Actually teach this to the people who work at Farcaster. Like it's part of what they need to do. Well, what I would say is it's interesting because I'm deeply introverted. I like to say like I'm an introvert or like I'm an extrovert, but I only play it on TV or I only play it on Farcaster. It's you can ask my wife. I'm like very much an introvert. I need my own time to kind of recharge. But I think that that is actually a natural tendency. And a lot of the people we've onboarded to Farcaster, they fall into two camps because they kind of tend to be more technical and it's Ethereum builder types. There's the extroverted type, which they get it right away. And then the introverted type is like, I don't feel comfortable or it's not perfect. And I think one people are just, you have to just get over that of like, just kind of put it out there and don't take yourself too seriously. And if you're in an app or environment where you can actually say something and then people kind of give you the benefit of the doubt or nuance, I actually think is more reinforcing to want to do that. I think what's challenging is if you're trained to Twitter, you kind of realize if you have a bad take, like you just could be descended on with like the quote tweet and then like all these other people who want to hate on it. So I think that that's one thing that people just, when they start to try to use Forecaster, like, whoa, like I got like actually quality engagement and not engagement and likes, but in terms of like people actually responded to the question. It's actually, that's one thing I say to everyone is, one thing that Forecaster does really well right now, while it's still small and hopefully we can talk about it more, and continue to try to scale this, is if you ask a question, you're going to get, I think, generally pretty good responses. And I think part of that is like the size of the community, but it's also just generally people are craving this ability to actually have like a conversation versus, I think sometimes with something like Twitter, given how mature and at scale it is, people view that very much as kind of this broadcast platform that's where you do your shilling and all that kind of stuff. I think that the second thing is, and I try to do this myself, is like, I think memes are like a pretty good icebreaker in the sense that you can either take it from somewhere else, which is the Elon strategy, right? He doesn't make his own memes. He gets them from his meme dealer. But I actually try to make memes on a regular basis. I think it's like people talk about Sudoku being good for your brain or, you know, word puzzles. But like, I actually think it's like communicating with an image template that the same thing that you would want to say in text is a little bit more amusing, right? To see SpongeBob doing it with Squidward is more interesting than me writing the same thing. So you have something you want to say, and instead of trying to like craft it into a short form written thing, you're like, I have this to say, how do I put it into a meme? Yeah, and actually there's even more compression there, right? Because what you're importing is the point of the meme, which requires a little bit more intellectual engagement from people, but they actually probably find it fun, especially if it's kind of funny. And then you can actually put the actual message and you're writing some text still. But I think that that like is another interesting way because I think there are certain people who are so good at Twitter. Like they know exactly how to like put everything in. And it's like, you're like, I can never be this funny. But I actually always say to people is using a meme template, like you're basically getting someone else's creative output and then you're just putting a thin layer on top of it. And you actually look, there are some accounts on Twitter that are very good at Twitter, like Turner Novak, VC, not really into crypto. He's extremely good at seeing kind of like what's happening in the meme-osphere and then like bringing it in for the like tech Twitter take of the day. And like, I think that's brilliant. And it's like, I actually think more people can do that because it's like, they have an observation they wanna make, but by kind of doing it with a meme, it also kind of de-escalates a bit. Whereas like you have this profound statement as like a tweet or a cast. It feels like you're doing this versus if you kind of like my feeling when.
