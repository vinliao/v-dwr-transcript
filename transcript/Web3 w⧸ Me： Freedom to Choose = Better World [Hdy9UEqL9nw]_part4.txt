it's like, yeah, it would actually be kind of nice to have a decentralized, credibly neutral platform that no one entity can control. In the same way that we have with cars or newspapers or whatever. And the optionality if that changes. Market you can think of. That's beautiful. Well, we went on an awesome tangent for the entire episode. That was awesome, Dan. I do have to ask you my two traditional closing questions and I'll have to bring you on again if you're open to it because I think there's just a lot of interesting things happening in your space and you're kind of at the forefront. You have a front row seat to all this. So anyways, the two traditional closing questions that I have are, how do you describe Web3? Permissionless innovation and the ability to kind of have true ownership over things that are important to you. And it's not quite like own your data because I actually don't think that that matters as much. But the idea that if you have an audience, that relationship is directly between you and the audience and no one can kind of go and muck with that. So that to me, that's ownership. Gotcha. And then the last one's forward looking. Where do you see yourself in this industry, Web3 crypto in the next six to 12 months? And where do you see yourself in the industry five to 10 years from now? Six to 12 months, I think we're gonna be a pretty choppy environment for at least six months or a year, maybe longer. And so I think what we've really been focused on with Farcaster is just, we know what we wanna accomplish and try to keep focused and making progress and listening to feedback from the developers and the ecosystem and the people using the product today. So that's how I think of it as like, we're fortunate that we have plenty of funding so we can actually kind of be a little bit blinders, heads down. I think in the longer term, five, 10 years from now, I'm extremely bullish on some protocol breaking through and I hope it is Farcaster, but you never know. And so what I do think is five to 10 years from now, the core protocols that we're using for kind of social media I think will be X number of more clicks to centralize. I don't think centralized social media companies are going away. They have an insane scale and user experience. And I think the average user really likes using a lot of those products, right? It's like average person likes using Instagram and TikTok. That's just the reality. Now there are a whole bunch of other moving pieces, like whether it's political or kind of these trends. But I do think if the technology and kind of the early users can kind of bootstrap an ecosystem where there is an alternative, you're gonna start to pick off the types of creators who are saying, hey, I actually do wanna be kind of creating an insurance policy where I have a following on maybe something like YouTube, but maybe a decentralized version of YouTube. Because now if I lose access to that platform, I still have a way over here. And I think that the permissionless innovation that will start to happen in the kind of decentralized social networking protocols where anyone can go build a client, which doesn't exist on Twitter today, doesn't exist on Instagram or YouTube. I think that is the thing that we're like, if you think of it as like a little bit of a kindling of a fire that if we can really stoke and get going, then the new innovation that will start to come out of the kind of decentralized ecosystem of apps may actually be on par, if not better, from just like solving a consumer problem that they didn't even know had. And like people actually just wanna use because they're delightful new products. And so we're really, really early there because we're just still trying to get the ecosystem booted up and it's this kind of like, how do you will a flywheel into existence? But I think over the five to 10 year timeframe, if you just take it as a whole, as a category, I really do believe that the permissionless innovation will way out-compete whatever the centralized social networks, even with their ability to go and try to copy. Yeah, yeah, I like that. It's like almost the more that we build, the easier it will be to onboard people in a way, right? Just cause there'll be so many options that like there, why wouldn't you almost, right? Like if you have the option to communicate with and partake in things that you value highly, like here's your option to go do that eventually if there's enough clients out there that are doing the right thing, so. Cool, man, I appreciate you coming on, Dan. This was an awesome conversation. I have to say like super enlightening, loved your analogies. I learned a ton and I hope my audience does too.
