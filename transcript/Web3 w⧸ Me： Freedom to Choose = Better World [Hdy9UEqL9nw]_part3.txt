It's like, let's get rid of those. And then it's just like you're compiling what's actually happening at the protocol level between the people who are arguing good faith from team yellow and good faith from team green. And now you're exposed outside of these filter bubbles. You, if you choose the purple client, are exposed to a rich intellectual tapestry of all these different ideas. And we actually get to a much more idealized thing. But the key thing here is the people who build that purple client, they're free to go build that, right? You cannot do that on Twitter today. Twitter does not allow you to build third-party clients. And even if you go back to the regime that existed prior where you could build a third-party client like Tweetbot or TweetDeck, or no, TweetDeck, so Tweetbot or Twitterific, you still didn't have access to the full fire hose. And so it's not like you could actually build some algorithmic feed that's trying to surface the best of Twitter. The best you could get is like who you were following. And so I think in a world where you assume that the kind of like substrate for what's actually happening in this kind of like public open discourse is a protocol, you are gonna have a kind of marketplace of clients that can cater to different types of people. And I don't think you can actually go change human nature. So there are going to be people who want the blood sport that is Twitter and like team yellow versus team green, and that's okay. But there are gonna be a whole bunch of people who probably are interested in team purple because they're like, hey, this is actually great. Like I get exposed to the smartest people on the internet for free. And so that's like the idealized version of what we're trying to go build. Now, getting from 10,000 people in a crypto centric network to kind of this like global public commons, that's a lot of work between here and there. And I mean, that's what we're trying to figure out. Yeah, no, that's a good way of putting it. It's almost like the, and maybe there is an element of transparency that you add to your clients so people understand what you're filtering for, or maybe they just got to figure it out on their own as they interact with your client. But that level of transparency and publicity and what you are doing is actually allowing you to filter for the low run thinking, because everybody that is in the top notch of this are the best thinkers in the space. They just happen to lean one way. And I think that's what gets lost a lot is that there are a lot of really smart liberals, capital L liberals. There are a lot of really smart conservatives, right? But the way that you would portray them on Twitter right now, at least the way I think about it is like, oh, well, if they believe something I don't believe, then they must be bad, right? But like really, like they're really smart people and they have a reason. They have very clear reasoning, like you're talking about, that they believe in those things. And this is allowing people to make that decision for themselves. And I love that you combined it in the purple because obviously Forecaster's purple, but then they meet in the middle and they've got like this neutral ground where it's like, I actually just wanna understand the whole playing field. I guess how, like the other problem that's inherent in this is like tip the reason that people are so worried about how polarized things are right now and how everything is politicized is because the loudest voices in the room are typically the ones that get the most following and get the most coverage, get the most broadcast like reach, right? So the moderates, which is where I would consider myself, right? Like we haven't, like we aren't typically a loud people and that's what's kind of allowing these other like very polarizing sides to proliferate. Is there a way that you can allow the moderates to speak to these two polarized groups in a productive way? I don't know. Like, is that possible if you build the purple client? I guess is the question. So my, like, A, from a historical basis, I think polarization has always existed. And like, there's like this kind of nostalgia for some era that didn't exist. Like, it was like, people always disagree. Like politics have always existed, right? You want disagreement to an extent. And so it's like, what we have now is we're just online and like things move at the speed of the internet. And so, and there's always a recency bias. Everyone always thinks that they're living in like the pivotal moment in history. It's just like, that's how humans work, right? So like, there is no version where like, we live in the society where the extremes don't exist. And here's the wrinkle with the internet. Is the extremes traditionally did not have any means for distribution outside of within their own weird extreme, on both sides, right? Or, you know, if you think it's even multi-party on, and any side. What the current state of social media does, because it's centralized at scale, ad driven. So when you have an ad driven at scale model, time spent is the thing you care about. What is upstream of that? It's clickbait. Why? Because it's the most entertaining. It is genetically engineered. Like if you think of like Twitter as constant AB desk. Show me the incentives and I'll show you the man. Right, and so like, let's say you have this like really, and I actually, the reason I use the yellow green, because I think it's just like, as soon as you say red, blue, like people are like, they immediately shift into team mode, right? And so like, you know, it's like red and blue actually create purple, but I like using yellow and green, because you have no association for what that means, at least in the US, right? Some other countries where that means one thing. But if you basically have like an interesting thinker and team yellow, and then you have the high rung people and the low rung people, what will happen is that idea or thing that they're talking about, that they in good faith are like, how can we potentially solve it? Here are some, the way that it's like a game of telephone, it filters down to the low rung, and then they use the kernel and build something around it that just gets the most likely to click or the inflammatory thing that within that side, which by the way, they're doing it for their side, for the team to like get engagement, but what they actually want is the quote tweet from the other side to increase the distribution and the beef, right? Like there's a concept called the Streisand effect, where it's just like, you like any effectively, like any additional publicity, like if you try to tamp down something, it actually will increase publicity. And there's the traditional line, it's like any publicity is good publicity. It's like the fact that like you can say something inflammatory over here, that you get a bunch of likes on your team, drives the other team so crazy that they then turn it into an issue. It's like the account lives of TikTok. Like the whole reason that that account is so popular is not because there's a whole bunch of people who believe what it's saying. Yes, there are people like that. It's because the other side, it drives them crazy, right? And so your audience is actually 100% of the extreme people on both sides. And then the moderate people are in the middle kind of just being like, what the hell? It's like, it's just like a constant fight between these two people on both sides. And so that's where I think, again, it goes back to if you have that ability to have a marketplace of clients and you can opt into using a client that's like, I just don't wanna see either side of these extremes. Like I literally wanna see like photos of astronomy or like, and Reddit is actually a good example of this. Think of like subreddits where they're like more topical based. I just like literally wanna live in a client where I just never see like the two ad hominem sides of like, and deep fake videos and all this other kind of, like whatever literally the current thing on the internet that day is and team yellow and team green are fighting over. I just like, I wanna see like, what's the latest ML paper. And I don't actually wanna see anything about ML alignment because that's effectively a political issue. Just show me the like, I don't even wanna say ArcVix or whatever the like paper that came out. That's what I wanna see. And by the way, if you use a feed reader like today, like an RSS feed reader, it's like pretty esoteric and niche that's basically what you get. Like you can literally never have to worry about seeing some like crazy other thing outside of one of the blogs that you're choosing to follow decides to cover it. And if that blog gets to like, you're just like, man, like all they doing is talking about this like political stuff that I'm not that interested in. You just unsubscribe, boom, and you never see it again. And so it's like daring fireball, great example. I've been reading that blog for 15 years and he has a political bent, right? Like he's a liberal and like he hates Republican stuff and he loves Democrats stuff. And like that's just who he is. I go through those posts. I actually read them. I found out he's like, I think he's a smart person. So I'm curious of like how he's approaching that. But I'm not there for that. I'm there for the Apple content. If he went 100% politics, I would unsubscribe. Then I'm done. Like he's free to do that. He has his own website. And I'll just continue to read the other 300 blogs that I have in my feed that are talking about topics that I'm just a little bit more interested in reading. But so I think like what we can do is if we can get into a protocol based social network, you as the adult, assuming other people go build these clients and make these parameter choices, and maybe there'll be open source clients, which then you can tune just like a feed reader to whatever you want, you can opt into the version of the public square that you want. And if you don't want a whole bunch of other stuff and you're just like, I don't want this like blood, sport, entertainment, you don't have to follow it, right? And like here's a really basic example from traditional media. You ever watch the nightly news in the local market? Not really. OK, well, not today. But did you like growing up maybe? Yes, we were growing up. It was an event. You sat down at dinner and you might have turned it on. Right, exactly. It's just like that pre-internet, like that's how my parents would watch it every night. And whenever I was old enough to be able to stop, I'd watch it. It is the most formulaic, same thing every single night, where it's if there is a murder or a thing that is scary, that is the lead story. That's just like the way it works, right? And it's like, why are people doing it? Because it's kind of like, that sounds like entertainment, like in the sense that it's like it gives you something to talk about the water cooler the next day. And so people have been doing this forever. But I don't think anyone serious would have ever said watching the nightly news, the regional nightly news in wherever you are, compared to reading a couple of newspapers. Let's say you read the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, which have different points of view. Like, which of those two things is going to give you a better perspective on what's happening on the world? Watching the nightly news or reading those two things. And here's the thing. If you're reading the New York Times or you're reading the Wall Street Journal or The Economist, that's a filter bubble. That is an editorialized algorithm that shows up whether it's daily or once a week. But you opt into it. You could say, hey, you know what? I'm finding the Wall Street Journal's too radical on this or the New York Times too radical on that. And maybe I'll subscribe to the Financial Times, which is an international perspective, if that's what you believe in. But the whole point is that there is a marketplace of algorithms in news, at least traditionally. But I think as we've moved more towards Twitter, now the algorithm that is centralized there actually dictates effectively what the current thing is with the front page. And so moving back to a model where you as an adult get to make the decisions on what your diet looks like, because there are other opportunities for clients that actually respect that ability and say, oh, the consumer says they don't want to see this. We're going to do a really good job preventing you from seeing this, because maybe they're monetized via subscription. They don't have to worry about the amount of time spent you have in ads and things like that. So that's the world I want to get to, is actually just move it closer to web one, where everything is a website. And it's like you pick the websites if you like Drudge Report or you like Nothing to Post or Yeah, exactly, or Daily Kos. There's a rich tapestry of different levels of political extremism or what are talking points, memos, and other ones. I think that whole early internet culture of like, you could actually kind of pick the intellectual bent that you wanted, I think we're just missing that today, because so much of it is reduced to a single app's algorithmic decisions, which are focused on time spent, which inevitably turn into the bloodsport entertainment. Whereas Talking Points memo might have taken something that they saw on Breitbart or Drudge, and they do this big dunk takedown, but they don't get any additional distribution with the quote tweets and retweets and people dunking back and forth. It's like you had to actually go over there. And so that speed of the kind of fight, is the latency significantly increases, which I think requires a little bit more nuance and thought than the 140 character, I guess now technically it's unlimited on Twitter. But part of it is like, show me the incentives, like I'll show you the outcome, and also just the culture. And I think that that's where Twitter is today. And so what I'm hoping with Farcaster is because of the multi-client ecosystem that we help to propagate, you're gonna have dozens of different cultures and you can actually pick into the one that you- I think it's so necessary to have multiple cultures. I was actually talking about that this morning with a friend over coffee and you need all of these people available. I think what you're saying is that now we're giving me the power, the intent to engage back to you as an individual and you can choose what you want to do just as easy as you can subscribe or unsubscribe to a blog. Consumer choice. I think it's like, people wanna frame decentralized social as a censorship thing. Average person doesn't care about that. Maybe a creator, publisher, developer, like you can make the arguments that they're more sensitive to that, given that like they've built an audience or an app and they can have that rug pulled. The consumer, what they, they like markets where they have more choice because that means competition. And it means people are building apps that try to appeal to their unique set of needs, right? And so if you have a single app, they can just optimize for wherever they want because the only way to get access to that Twitter graph is through the official Twitter app. But if you now have a marketplace of those apps, maybe none of them are actually as big as a traditional centralized social media, but in aggregate, that marketplace solves for the kind of like unique needs of a wider variety of people. Just think about if the market for cars, okay, the only car you could buy is a Tesla. Do you think Teslas would be worse or better quality? You got no other choice. Switching costs, there are no switching costs. You can't switch. Here you go. Cars today. I, let's say I'm like super pro, like we need to reduce fossil fuel dependence and I wanna have an electric car. Now I have this conundrum, because I don't also like Elon, because I think I disagree with his politics or whatever. You have the freedom to either choose to use a Tesla, which I think by most people's estimate is the best electric car in the market. Or you can say, you know what? I am going to weigh the quality of my car relative to my dislike of Elon. And I'm gonna go buy, I don't know, a Nissan or like whatever equivalent alternative. But you as the consumer have the choice to be able to do that. Like that is actually important. And you can vote with like, I never wanna give that guy another dollar. Great, you're free to do that. That actually is infinitely, I think more impactful from like actually steering the way things work in society is if you can vote with your dollars and the market can actually say, hey, you know what? Tesla's actually starting to lose market share, despite if you just like ignored the logo and just like evaluated the car, because Elon's antics are so infuriating to the group of people that are interested in buying electric cars. I can guarantee you that will actually make Elon modulate a little bit more. That is like way more likely to actually get him to change how he's behaving than you dunking on him on Twitter. So it's like, I think like in a world where now all of a sudden, imagine Twitter actually had to be built on a protocol. Like it's just like, there's that hypothetical. Overnight, all of the people who dislike Elon would be switching to a different client. Whereas now they have to go to Macedon or, you know, Forecaster or whatever, but like Forecaster is not permissioned to sign up. So most of them went to Macedon and you've already seen this huge correction in the total number of people using Macedon because the reality is what they actually care about, the reveal preferences, that distribution. And so they're kind of sheepishly still using Twitter. And you can always see this, the people who make the loudest noise about going to Macedon, just go to their likes on Twitter, they're still on Twitter because you can see how recent their likes are. And so maybe they're not as publicly vocal, but the thing is they're probably spending a ton of time watching the app, even if they're hate watching it. And so getting to a world where you actually have this like kind of public comments on a protocol and someone you really dislike takes over the biggest client that you're using, you can just seamlessly move to another client. And then boom, you can continue to talk to your people. You don't have all this work that you have to go rebuild. Maybe there's a set of features with that new client that you actually really enjoy. Like, so that's the vision of what we're trying to get to. And it's just like, okay, well, we have 10,000 people in the network today. Like, how do we actually get there? I love that. I mean, and what you were just explaining with the client, with Elon, with Tesla's is something that has really been highlighted in the Web3 crypto Twitter spaces. The ability to buy things based on the way they identify who you are, right? You've got this kind of identity layer that has never been really super possible before, but you've just explained it that you can actually approach your car buying with that same level of identity is like, I actually went and got the Hyundai electric vehicle before I got the Tesla because I hate Elon, right? Not because it's a better car, because they just started making electric cars, but because of that. That's a really good analogy. I love that. Right, and so the idea is like consumer choice creates moderate behavior. Because if you go to extreme, yeah, you'll have your set of extreme customers over here, but assuming there's an equivalent someone can actually switch over to, they may not wanna go choose that, right? And like take another dumb example. Let's say my pillow built the best possible pillow. Like you just like objectively everyone, like if you did blind taste test or the pillow test, they would do that. I can guarantee you that like, if that was the scenario of the world, people would still not buy that pillow because they don't like the outspokenness of the politics of that one individual, right? But the pillow market is like an extremely low barrier to entry, right? So it's like, anyone can go build, you can build like, I mean, literally Purple is a company that like builds mattresses and pillows, but like the whole point here is when you don't have these monopolistic lock-in effects, you get a very dynamic consumer choice oriented market that if people wanna optimize for having the most pillows sold, I can promise you they're never gonna wanna do anything. They're just gonna wanna be like, I don't fucking love pillows. Like put your head on it and you're gonna go to sleep. And right, but like, that's the whole point. But when you start to get to these lock-in scenarios, you get to be king, like you can do whatever you want. And so, the irony of this whole situation is the group of people that don't like Elon with Twitter, right, we're the same group of people that, when they kicked Trump off, we're like, well, go build your own social network, like too bad. And so it's like intellectual, like just like not thinking through, like any system, you want the set of incentives so that if your worst enemy flips over to controlling the thing that you thought was like a given under your team, they can't abuse it. And so the way to do that is through open protocols that are credibly neutralized, credibly neutral and decentralized and permissionless. And so I think we're finally at a point in society where I think people, maybe not the extremes, but like the people who are actually kind of the high rung thinking on different sides of the political spectrum can all agree on generally.
