Farcaster is a decentralized social media platform built on Ethereum, designed to provide a more open and permissionless experience for users. The platform consists of three layers: identity, data, and application.

The identity layer is based on the Ethereum blockchain, with Farcaster IDs issued by a smart contract, ensuring each user has a unique, decentralized numeric identifier. Users can also optionally register a ForecasterName, a human-readable username connected to their Farcaster ID. This creates a balance between decentralized and trustworthy namespaces.

The data layer is responsible for storage and replication, with each node having a full copy of the network's data. The application layer handles message creation, feeds, and pushing messages to the data layer.

Farcaster utilizes a combination of gossip and diff sync processes to propagate messages across the network. New hubs join by connecting to at least one other hub and downloading contact information for all other hubs. The protocol also employs delta pruning to keep hubs small, ensuring decentralization as the network grows.

Key features of a secure messaging protocol in Farcaster include anti-forgery, end-to-end encryption, forward secrecy, break-in recovery, and metadata privacy.
