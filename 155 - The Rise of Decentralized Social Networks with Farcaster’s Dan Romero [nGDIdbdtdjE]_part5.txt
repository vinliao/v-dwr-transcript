relationship we just described, and the clients themselves would be the private sector here. And I suppose you would be open to all sorts of new models on the client side that Web3 enables. So back to my early example of Twitter, the only model, the only way for them to appease their shareholders and make money and return value to the investors, which is necessary, by the way, let's not live in a naive world where investors invest in things without expectation of maximizing their upside. But you could have things that aren't maybe ad revenue funded, for example, in the clients. So NFTs, like a client, you can imagine a forecaster, maybe you'll get some kind of transaction fee type revenue for the amount of posts or the amount of NFTs that are sold inside of the client. Or maybe there's some other token funding apparatus that is more Web3 native and less eyeball centric. We make money based on the number of eyeballs we get in this system. So I guess that private sector is even more diverse than the Web3 social, which just depends on attention as the currency, depends on advertising as the sponsor of everything, where all users become the product. Yeah. So I fully expect there to be clients in the forecaster ecosystem that use advertising. It's the reveal preference of billions of consumers, they like free and they're willing to have their attention taken by an ad. I don't think all ads are bad either. But I think what we're planning to do with our client, so I can speak to that, is we're going to have a freemium model. So we're going to actually have subscriptions. And our strategy is to keep our team extremely small, like from a core team. So our general expenses are going to be pretty low. And we think that within a reasonable number of years in terms of growth, we continue to grow 5% every week, we will get to a place where we're break even or profitable based on some percentage of users willing to subscribe for the kind of like pro subscription. And I think subscriptions in 2022 are much more normalized for consumers to say, hey, I'm actually spending a lot of time in this app. I'm willing to subscribe a few dollars a month to the more kind of like premium version of that. And so that's something we're going to test. I think you're spot on in that if your feed has a bunch of stuff that's happening on chain, there's a natural economic model with that. And one example I always bring up, a lot of people don't realize, Apple gets paid $20 billion a year by Google for the default search placement in Safari on iOS. So that's probably their highest. It's $20 billion? $20 to $0 billion. And that's got to be pretty profitable. It's their highest profit margin line of business. There's no cost. It's literally, it's just, you know, you can either be DuckDuckGo, Bing or Google and Google pays $20 billion. It's a real estate. Because you can change it. It's not like it's like the only option. And so that's an amazing model when you have some amount of scale, right? Like, you know, obviously Apple has a lot of scale, but Firefox's entire budget basically is just the fact that they have the user base that they do. And Google pays to be the default little search bar in Firefox. And so, and now you realize why Chrome is so valuable because they don't have to pay themselves that. But in our case, we have the NFTs. You can imagine our client saying, okay, what's the default? If you click on a link in an NFT, where does it go? And now you potentially have different marketplaces being willing to bid on that. Or if you mentioned a cryptocurrency, it's like, where are you going to trade it? And so I think the idea space for this kind of like transaction-based commerce is something that was frankly, and maybe Elon fixes this with Twitter. I don't want to count them out. But Twitter is this kind of like feed of information and the ability for you to like tap in two things and then buy a recommended, you know, someone tweets a link to the wire cutter. Like why isn't there a deal where you're surfacing that product review right in the feed? Not oppressively, it's like, I'm interested in this click, it opens up and then I can actually do the commerce right there. I think that there's just a whole idea space that can happen there. And then the beauty is people are inventing new things in crypto all the time that are going to have natural built-in economic models. And so what I would like to get to is a place where basically we never have to have ads because we figured out other ways to monetize and also kept our cost structure really lean. But even at that case, like you can imagine maybe when we have 10 million or a hundred million people, there's a tier of user that's like, hey, I actually just want the bare bones completely free. And then maybe you're showing them some simple ad. But like by no means are we interested in doing that in the near term. And here's the beauty of the protocol. If that's the wrong decision, some other app is going to come along, offer all the same features they're going to offer an ad-based client and the reveal preference of users will that they'll use it and then we'll have to confront and potentially change that. So I think that that is a world that I want to live in where we can run these experiments and let the market decide rather than, you know, you make a decision 14 years ago. And actually I think with Twitter now that they're not public and they're owned by one person, they're actually having an opportunity to rethink that business model. And if you were to ask me what is a Twitter that is not owned by Elon today, it's they made the bold decision early on that they weren't going to monetize like Facebook. And instead they were going to say, Hey, we're going to monetize better than any online newspaper. Right. Because we know these people who are really into Twitter, probably willing to pay 20, $30 a month. And maybe they didn't have 6,000 people. They had 1200 people or whatever. But I think from first principles, I think you can get to a reasonable, profitable business with a subscription model that you don't even assume most people subscribe to. Like assuming you just are really, really efficient in terms of keeping your head count lean. Dan, this has been such a great exploration into the world of the future of social media networks and I'm pretty sure listeners or imaginations are probably running wild right now. There's a few more conversations I just want to quickly check the box of just to, as we wrap this up. One is like, what is the actual on-chain footprint of this thing? Like it's not its own blockchain, correct? And I want to make sure that that gets communicated, but what are the actual crypto things that are about Farcaster? What is its footprint in the world of crypto? Yeah, so you have two parts on-chain. Today it's on Ethereum testnet, it's on Gurley, and it's moving to mainnet hopefully halfway through this year. And you sign up, you get an FID, a Farcaster ID, and it's just an incrementing number. So if you're the 10,000 user, that's your number. That's largely abstract away from people, but that's actually critical for the whole system to work. Then there's an optional $10 a year kind of like username, like kind of premium account, and effectively that those are the two primitives that is also an NFT. So that can actually be permissions to put into anything in ERC721 works with. OpenSea, you can put it on, I don't know, PseudoSwap, you can use it with PartyBid, completely composable. So wait, my account is an NFT? Yes. I hope you got a good username there, David. Well, I hope I don't lose it. No, no, no, you won't lose it. Any active user during the testnet, we're going to migrate to mainnet on our dime. But then it's $10 a year, just like it would be if you own a domain to pay and you pay directly to the protocol. But yeah, that is the core primitive on Ethereum, relatively simple set of smart contracts. But the core of the whole system is all mapped to that. So if I post something from DWR, which is my username, every time that happens, there are servers that are effectively checking Ethereum to make sure that the public key, which is an Ethereum address, matches the private key that signs that content. And it all just magically works. And then the other question I want to talk about is the world of content moderation and spam prevention. As someone who has been absolutely hounded by Twitter bots lately, how does spam prevention work in a decentralized network? Like, aren't you just opening yourself up to spam attacks? So one of the things, again, small team, and we're just trying to focus on what we think are the most important priorities first, is it's gated to sign up. And we actually took inspiration from Facebook on this. Facebook is still the largest social network in the world. And for the first two, two and a half years, it was gated to.edu email addresses. And our approach is we need to get hubs out, we need to get to Ethereum mainnet. And then the second half of this year, it's figure out how do you get to completely permissionless onboarding. And then I think you start to hit a bar where, okay, the protocol is actually permissionless. But as a result of that, we haven't had any spam issues for the most part, because everyone right now has to come through my Twitter DM. And that's not sustainable long-term, we're moving away from that. But I think that that's allowed us to A, keep the community small and incrementally grow rather than have it grow too fast, people kind of turn and then it feels like a ghost town. And I think the long-term solution, and this is not fully baked, so there's a little bit of a punt here, but I think the high-level answer is something like PageRank, which powers Google is as the social network develops and you've kind of had time for kind of the active users, you can actually start to map any given user on the network, how they interact with all the other users. And it gets very difficult for a spammy account to penetrate the core of the network in a way that if you basically get good on your kind of machine learning, data science, you could potentially even publish that information so that any client out of the box can get actually decent spam filtering with the caveat that that client can choose, hey, actually I don't think this account is spammy or whatever. So they can modulate how they want to approach content moderation. I also think that what's important is similar to email, which everyone uses content moderation in email, which is called spam filtering. It's a client level decision versus the network level decision, which is relatively straightforward. The only thing you can store on Farcaster is texts, like 320 character little tweets like things. And so the amount of stuff that you can actually put on there that is really bad from like an image standpoint and video content is relatively limited. That said, you could still put some nasty stuff in 320 characters, but inevitably what you're going to have is you're going to have clients are going to do the same thing they would do with emails is they're going to say, okay, we're going to not allow hate speech or abuse or all this other stuff. But that will again be a client level feature, which is how the internet works, right? It's like how the web works. Like Google doesn't have to index your webpage, but that doesn't mean your webpage went offline. So even if it's full of deplorable stuff, Google just takes it out of the index. You just get no distribution. And I think that that is the content moderation gets wrapped up in the fact that today, most of the platforms we're talking about from a content moderation standpoint are doing the hosting. They have the identity for their given platform and the distribution. And so thus they have to do content moderation because then people are like, well, why are you hosting this video? Or why is that tweet still up? Where the reality is if you have a marketplace of clients, first of all, there's no single omni algorithm, right? Like each client's going to have a different way that they're implementing that. And B, I think the average user does want some amount of content moderation. But like when we have a marketplace of ways of solving it, we call it spam filtering, right? So we're talking about platforms on low quality versus this, like, is this fundamentally something that should be posted or not? I don't think most people are that worried about like the fact that there are some really kooky websites out there on the internet, but if they don't have any distribution, it doesn't really matter. Right. Yeah. And that kind of just answers my next question, which was like discoverability and the algorithm, right? The reason why we bankless post videos to YouTube is because the YouTube algorithm allows us to be discoverable. But I'm going to go ahead and guess that the future web three protocol version of this is the same answer that it was for spam prevention. It's just like that is a vector upon which the clients compete upon and discoverability and whose algorithm is best, whose algorithm is most enjoyable by people and makes them feel good is probably something that the client layer competes upon. And it's also probably the way that Farcaster also becomes like compliant with nation state regulations is that clients are going to have to like make sure that no illicit activity is happening on them. But that doesn't, that's no longer responsibility of the protocol. Like the protocol is permissionless, but clients still got to make sure that the activity inside of the specific client is like not going to trigger the ire of regulators. If it's like, you know, illicit trades or, you know, all the bad things that happen on the internet, that is still something that the clients have to optimize for and work on that the protocol doesn't leaving the protocol still like peer and permissionless. Yeah, it's very similar to Coinbase, right? Like Coinbase has to keep things clean on their end and they're subject to the laws in the countries they operate in. But the blockchain is a protocol and what happens on there, they have to take care of what interacts with them. And I think that that is the right approach because it works really well for the web and email. And I think we have the possibility if we can achieve what we want to achieve with Forecaster for actually making the same for social. And I do think on the algorithm side, if you view that, like, let's say that there are five or 10 major apps and they all have a slightly different algorithm, instead of hacking the algorithm, which is a lot of like what happens on these like monopolistic networks, you actually get to a place where the best content across a variety of different algorithms is probably actually what succeeds, right? Because it's hard to fake quality versus any one algorithm probably can be gamed, but it's harder to fake 10 at a time. Dan, this could probably be this question I'm about to ask you could probably be an entire podcast. So we don't want to do that. But it's one thing I just wanted to cover before we close here and we're getting ready to. So we've been having on Bankless this conversation about identity and a quote from kind of Bankless. The Bankless thesis is phase one, we take back our money. Phase two, we take back our identity. And social certainly has a role in web three in phase two, I think. How does this fit with the story of identity? How does Farcaster kind of feed into that? We just had the folks from Signing with Ethereum on the podcast. People can look at that in the archive, Bankless listeners, in like maybe 45 seconds or so, could you could you help us answer that question? Does this play a role in decentralized identity in that story? I think it does. I think, look, you can today and Vitalik is a great example of this, you can have your own website, and that can kind of be the primary pointer to your identity in the internet. The challenge is your website is going to have a very hard time in a very rare cases, getting distribution. And I think more people will be willing to actually start with a sovereign identity, something that they really do control and can kind of instantiate their identity or display their identity in any way they want, if they can associate it with distribution. And so I think with Farcaster or other kind of decentralized identity approaches, if you basically can have that be the pivot point, assuming that you can then get distribution for whatever you're trying to say or achieve in the world, I think that is the most promising path because, you know, like distribution is the thing that people care about, right? It's the reason as many of the people who are interested in decentralized social media and you know, all the things that Farcaster represents, that they still continue to use Twitter is because they already have large audiences there. And I can't fault them for it. Like that, that's actually a hard thing to do is build an audience and distribution. And so if we can do our part in making it easier to have a decentralized way of connecting with a large group of people, then I think you'll start to get sovereign identity. This is great. Bankless listeners. Hope you enjoyed this conversation with Dan. He's building a decentralized social network protocol called Farcaster. Of course, it's one of a couple that we will be a few, I should say, that we're exploring on Bankless and we certainly wish you well on your endeavors, Dan. This has been a fun conversation. Thank you for introing us to decentralized social media and also to Farcaster. Thanks for having me. And I'm happy to offer Bankless listeners a Farcaster account. Are you sure about that, sir? Because you know, you're about to get a lot of DMs. How about this? We'll keep it to the Bankless Nation Discord. The first hundred people who send me a message with the word in it, I'll put a little filter in my Twitter DM inbox. I'll know they have listened to the end of the podcast. Dan, is it okay if we beep that word out and only have that go out on the premium feed? There you go. That's the benefit of the premium subscription. So we've just beeped the word out. So if you want to unlock that beep, then go become a Bankless premium member and we'll save Dan's DM so he doesn't hear from the full Bankless community. Just the premium bankers. That's real proof of work. I guess that's probably not the right word on the podcast. Proof of listenership. Proof of shake. There you go. That's awesome. Well, we appreciate it, Dan. This has been a lot of fun. Thanks so much. Thanks for having me. I'm going to go turn off the cameras, guys. Got to end with this, of course. Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in, but we're headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey. First we take back our money, then we take back our identity. Thanks a lot. Hey, we hope you enjoyed the video.
