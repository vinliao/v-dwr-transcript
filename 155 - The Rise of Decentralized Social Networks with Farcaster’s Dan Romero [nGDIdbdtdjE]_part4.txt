out of the detriment of Twitter. But I see this like festival of the commons of Farcaster is when somebody triggers, invents like some cool new mechanism that's brand new, that can become an app on top of the Farcaster protocol and actually grow the utility of the protocol at large. And hopefully that is what unlocks a brand new like Cambrian explosion of cool new social features that exists on the internet. Is that what you see? Yeah, and so going back to, I would give TikTok as probably the one counter example to the last 10 years. But other than that, and maybe Snap, if you wanna go back that far, but very few, right? I think the way to think about client competition on something like Farcaster, so let's, you know, someone comes up with the Clubhouse equivalent on Farcaster and we have this initial client and has a lot of users. And so if we try to do the same thing that Twitter did with Spaces, right? The advantage Twitter had with Spaces is not Spaces was a better product, Spaces had more distribution, right? So if you do a Spaces for Bankless versus a Clubhouse for Bankless, you already have a huge audience on Twitter, right? And so I can guarantee you if YouTube did a Spaces product or I guess do they have it, it's like YouTube Live, but something equivalent, it would also be really popular because there's a lot of existing users and distribution. And I think what's key with Farcaster is, so if someone goes and clones, you know, one of the bigger apps on the ecosystem clones, the kind of up and coming, the one who innovated, they have to continue to keep pace because the distribution is actually put at the protocol level. So now as a user, if I actually wanna listen to the equivalent of a like, you know, audio room that is at the Farcaster protocol level, I can actually choose the best client rather than have to say, oh, do I wanna choose the distribution or the feature set? And so you can actually get both where the client that you opt into has the feature set, but you can still have access to the entire social graph and in distribution. And so going back to this idea of monopolistic tendencies, it forces clients to actually have to be extremely responsive to users because otherwise someone's going to get their attention, right? And so from our standpoint, look, we have, you know, 99% market share today because we're the initial client. There are a whole bunch of other clients being built right now. And as we build the ecosystem out and make it easy for users to actually move between clients, I consider it a huge success if we only end up having 10 or 20% share, assuming we've grown the Farcaster protocol because that to me is the success of the protocol. And then we're gonna end up with a better ecosystem because these apps are gonna be competing on feature set, not distribution and like proprietary lock-in where I think that that's where we've gotten a lot of, the reason things are so stagnant, right? Instagram had this whole controversy recently where they're adding more videos to compete with TikTok. And you had a whole bunch of users, a lot of high profile users even being like, we don't like this. Like we want to have it be more like the traditional Instagram where it's photos or stories. And the beauty of a system like Farcaster is if the equivalent of Instagram is built on Farcaster and has a massive audience, assuming it's on the protocol, you can actually go build the traditional Instagram client, which actually someone did. And what did Instagram do? They sued them for access to the API and then got them kicked out of the app store. Whereas in this system, it'll be like, oh, this is a better client. I'm gonna go shift over there. And two examples like this exist in the web one world. So the first is browsers. Netscape starts it, Internet Explorer crushes them through a variety of kind of underhanded tactics through bundling. And then what happens is Firefox comes out and Firefox without any huge budget or anything wins a massive amount of market share on the merit of just being a better browser. And the beauty of the web is I can go, there was no lock-in of IE for the most part. And then Google comes along and says, well, we're gonna build a better browser than Firefox and got a lot of share. Whereas now with these mobile app stores, essentially Apple and Google can actually force and actually more Apple than Google, cause I think Android's a little bit more open here. Apple basically can say we're the only the browser on iOS. Like Chrome is like basically this wrapper on top of some APIs, but they don't get like full system access. And then the second one is superhuman can come along and just be like, we are literally giving you the same effective set of data that exists on Gmail, but we're gonna build a product that's so productive for the people who are excited about that. And we're gonna charge $30 a month or whatever they charge. And they can go do that because email by definition is kind of this permissionless thing where I can actually move my data between different clients. And so that's what we wanna get to with Fargaster where the best clients, the biggest clients are winning on the merits of their features, not some lock-in that they then can kind of extract. Like the classic example I always use with web two if it's not even social is Airbnb's cleaning fees. They're able to do that because it's like they've built this huge marketplace and brand and most consumers aren't gonna go try to go find the other things that exist out there. And so then they can kind of just keep turning the dial and not having to really respond to the market versus if you imagine that as a protocol, right? Like the ability to have the inventory as a protocol and then the trust and safety, which is actually the hard thing to go do. But if you can actually get that to a protocol and I haven't even thought about like how you'd actually go do that. But imagine if that was more of a protocol, then you'd have the best clients all competing on it, right? And that's actually in some ways, if you think about flights, a much better example where you used to have Hitmonk and Expedia and Kayak and Google flights, like people can actually compete on that data set. And that's not even a protocol, but it's just like having open access to data, you win on the merits of how functional the software you're building is, not some proprietary lock-in. So this all makes sense, but here's the question I'm trying to understand in my mind, Dan. So why? Let's go back to incentives, right? So Twitter certainly could have in the early days of Twitter not shut off its API, okay? It could have been a bit more standard centric and protocol centric in its design. Sure, it didn't have crypto, but it could have adopted for some kind of open standards. It could have made itself more rugless. But the reason they didn't is because they had, back to David's point earlier, they had venture capitalists, investors to please. And the model, the monetization model for social is ads. And so once they established their moat, right? It was a good business decision to then pick up the ladder and pull it up so that no one could kind of come behind them. They had no incentive to create this protocol behind them and to let competitors out innovate them because they were incented towards an advertising model in order to maximize the ROI for their investors. We understand this, this is kind of capitalism. And I can imagine forecasters not using sort of a Wikipedia model where it's purely like grants funded. That's the other example of how we've created kind of public goods on the internet. So can you tell me about the kind of the incentive mechanism? I mean, you've been talking about how you're very excited to propagate the forecaster protocol and not just the forecaster client. But then what further incentive do you have to continue building that protocol, I suppose? Or like, don't you want to be the most dominant client in the space? Are you planning to monetize this with ads? This is the part I don't understand is how do investors in something like forecaster maintain alignment? How do you yourself, your team maintain alignment? You were talking about, I would love to develop our client forever, like for as long as I can. Why? What is the monetization? What is the incentive mechanism here that keeps you aligned with the public good and the good of the protocol? Does my question even make sense? Yeah, it makes a total amount of sense. And I think that the answer is one, I can give you the most glib or whatever crafted answer. And this is something that is only earned through actions over a sustained period of time that people actually believe that I do care about the protocol or Varun and I care about making the protocol successful and not just our company is called Merkel Manufactory. So making Merkel successful. And so the way we approached it is one, Varun and I both worked at Coinbase. So we had some economic success coming out of Coinbase. And when we sat down to kind of like work on potential ideas, we were both aligned on wanting to work on something for 10 plus years and actually have it be meaningful and great to the point where we could look back when we were 80 and say, I'm really proud that I worked on that. There was only another companies we could have gone worked on letter kind of like very nuts and bolts SAS companies in crypto and probably could have grown it faster and gotten to revenue faster or whatever. We just didn't opt for that. We wanted to work on something for 10 plus years that we wanted people to actually kind of say that that's stupid that you're working on that. Like it's never gonna work. Because I think when you have long time horizons you can actually accomplish great things. The second thing is we bootstrapped the company for the first year and a half, not because of lack of investor interest is that we actually wanted to build the initial version of Forecaster and how we wanted to build it in the way we wanted to. Because again, we're aligned on the long-term here. When we did raise money last year and we raised money because one, we thought being able to scale the team a little bit more than we had originally planned would benefit the protocol. But two, I got a sense having been through multiple crypto winters at Coinbase that we were headed into a down market. So we started fundraising end of April, early May of last year, right before things imploded. So we got lucky on the time. But one of the things is we said to all the investors that we brought on board is we're optimizing for the protocol long-term and Varun and I have, you know, kind of voting control of the company. So like basically we're in the driver's seat around we can build the company the way we wanna do it. And our view, going back to that kind of analogy is today we have 99% market share or 95, whatever version of that high number you wanna pick. But we have 8,000 people in a beta. The goal here is to get to a hundred million, a billion people on Farcaster. And if we have 10%, in those two cases, you have 10 million or a hundred million users. Like that is gonna be great. And so I think that you have to earn the trust of the developer community within the Farcaster ecosystem. That I think will be majorly earned when we release hubs because then people will actually start to believe like, wait a second, like I have the same playing field access to the data and APIs that Merkle does with the amount of money that they raise, the fact that they were the first in the ecosystem, they have the most users. And it seems like Merkle is taking their API or their limited resources in terms of time and staff and building out features to like make it easy for an app developer to install. You can easily install a new Farcaster app and actually letting people export to a new client. And so upholding that standard. But I don't think that there's any deterministic way for anyone to believe that other than if we've been working on it for three, four years and we've consistently made, not perfect, but consistently made the right long-term decisions around optimizing for the protocol. And so that's the best answer I can give you is like, I believe it and I wanna show the world that I do, but until we hit a sufficient scale and hubs exist, I think it's completely reasonable for anyone to be skeptical. Dan, is it required that a protocol have a token for this to succeed? So I've just, we've used some analogs of the Ethereum foundation, for example, right? And basically if I were to kind of sum up the Ethereum foundation and what's done is it's bootstrapped it's R&D development based on the value of ETH, the token. And at some point the idea is that ETH maybe ossifies in some way. And actually ossify is not the right term, David, was the other term we were batting around? Homeostasis. It goes into homeostasis. Homeostatic. Where there's less development, ongoing development needed. And so kind of the Ethereum foundation is almost no longer needed as sort of a shepherd and kind of goes feeds into the background, but they've used the token price to kind of stay aligned with the rest of the ecosystem. So they're very aligned with, Arbitrum and Optimism, Layer 2, is anyone in DeFi because they have kind of that alignment in the token. Is a token needed in order to align parties for something like a decentralized social network? Or what do you think of that? So the way I think about it is the protocol, going back to your idea of like, how do you bootstrap R&D and continue to have a strong protocol that's independent? Protocol needs a source of revenue. And so the way we are going to actually test this is once we move to mainnet, we are actually going to have two types of forecaster accounts. There's an account that you can kind of register. Think of it as like you get a numerical ID and you own that forever. It's gas only, one time. So you could do that once and then you have a forecaster account forever. But we think that most people who are engaged on forecaster are going to actually be willing to pay some amount of money. We're going to test it at roughly $10 a year worth of Ethereum directly to a contract that is kind of like the protocol treasury contract. And if we're right about that hypothesis, could be wrong, but if we're right, then the protocol is actually going to have a sustainable yearly revenue source into perpetuity. That's something that email doesn't have or DNS or any of these other things that were kind of more academic and then got captured by a lot of the large internet companies. And so by having a revenue source of the protocol, now the protocol can actually start to hire its own team and actually get outside of like whether Merkle Manufacturer or other big companies in the space are actively contributing to protocol. Like we still want to, but like I want to get to a place where the protocol can actually really be independent. And then at that point, I think it's worth figuring out depending on how many users you have and how engaged people are, is how do you actually decentralize the core governance of that strategy away from the initial team? And so I have like kind of this very pragmatic or give myself credit on the pragmatism. I'm rooted in pragmatism most of the time. And my view is if we focus on the decentralization of the governance too early, we're going to spend way more time talking about like what the systems and processes should be versus actually making progress. And the thing that matters is like, we need to have a million or 10 million people who've signed up for this thing and proving people are willing to pay for the protocol and all this other stuff before we can worry about getting to those other things. Again, people might say- You don't want, never want to lead with algorithms. That's a bad idea. Right, you're just going to move slower. And so for our, like there's a term in open source software development, which is not what we want to do, but benevolent dictator for life. That's what Linus Torvalds says. Right. So we want to be ours is benevolent dictator until product market fit and then actually turn it over to the protocol. And look, some people will say, oh, well, what's your incentive? You're going to get there and you're going to want to, you know, hold on to control. Yeah, that would be the big corner response. But the reality is if I wanted to do control, why would I be spending all this time on the protocol stuff? Like I could be moving way faster. 50, 80% of my engineering resources on the team right now are spent on the protocol. And so like, this is the thing. I don't have to convince everyone on this. All I have to convince are an increasing number, small but steady group of people who are like buying into the vibe on Farcaster. And that's fine. Because if we can continue to show that we can grow it, we will get more and more permissionless over time. And I'm fine with that. And so I'm not walking around saying Farcaster is permissionless and all this stuff. That is aspirational at this point. But when we hit that bar, I'll be very happy to kind of pound my chest and say, hey, we've hit these milestones. And we do have actually a lot of decentralization and it is ruthless. But until then it's more aspirational and it's like we're actively investing resources in it. But I don't think it's intellectually honest for anyone to be claiming that if you haven't actually hit the threshold. No, that's cool. That's pretty grounded. Yeah, that was kind of the root of my question, right? Because like what you're looking for if you're doing a protocol is sort of a public sector and a private sector, right? And both need to be funded. And if we think about kind of governments, everyone's familiar with, obviously their nation state and they're familiar with taxes and then they're familiar with businesses. And so what you're saying is basically the Farcaster protocol could be configured in such a way that it has some sort of lightweight tax type system to pay for the public goods, which is maybe when you register your name or something, it was $10 in ETH per year. And this goes into a fund. And if you multiply that by large number of users, then you actually have a pretty good tax base in order to fund the public goods, the roads and the hospitals, of course, not those things literally in this case, but the public goods that everyone will share. Now, what you haven't figured out, which to be fair, no one in crypto has figured this out, is how to actually govern that treasury and make sure that it's managed effectively. Of course, like in the nation state, quite famously have large bureaucracies that sort of kind of do this work. Maybe crypto will develop something around that though. That's kind of the hope. I mean, we are working on these Gitcoin type governance, quadratic voting types of things, and something might come along. But that was the root of my question. So in a fully realized forecaster, you have this public sector, but then you have this private sector of all of these various clients that are creating businesses based on the public infrastructure and are competing with one another in a way, but they're also contributing towards the network effect of the protocol. And even they're contributing tax revenue to the protocol to the extent they're able to onboard users. That seems to me like a pretty grounded approach and does not necessarily require a token at the base layer. Although maybe that's a design strategy as well when you think about governance. Very helpful. Thank you. Yeah, and I think in some ways it's an improvement on Web1, which you always have to be careful about because like obviously Web1 has been incredibly successful. But I do think if you think about whether it's, I don't know, HTTP, DNS, SMTP, the fact that those protocols don't have a built-in revenue source despite billions of people using them. You have to run them as nonprofits that don't have any funding whatsoever, basically. Or get funding from the big internet companies who then get to decide what the standards are and what we want to work on. 100%. Things like that. Right, and so like a good example of like WebAuthn, which is like this new like touchless way of signing into things, they don't allow like arbitrary signing of like ECDSA curves or whatever. And if you wanted to actually get that done, it's this incredibly bureaucratic process run by kind of middle management at like the biggest browser manufacturers. And in a world where governance is a little bit more decentralized and like there is actually a revenue source directly to the protocol, one, the protocol hopefully is independent so that it can actually make its own decisions what's best for the protocol. But more importantly, if you actually get to a good solution for decentralized governance, if you want to have more influence there, you're gonna figure out, okay, this is the path to actually doing that versus this kind of opaque, big company. Like the fact that Microsoft, Apple, and Google can kind of get together and be like, eh, maybe we won't add this feature to the web browsers. And people will be like, oh, that's this conspiracy theory. And then it turned out like when Steve Jobs was around, they weren't recruiting engineers from each other because like big companies do do that. So I don't know, like I think, call me naive, but I do think having these public goods have a funding source is a improvement over the status quo. Oh, actually, I agree. As long as we can govern them effectively in a uncorruptible way. I guess just last piece here, then back to kind of the business model for a second. So remember that public private kind of.
