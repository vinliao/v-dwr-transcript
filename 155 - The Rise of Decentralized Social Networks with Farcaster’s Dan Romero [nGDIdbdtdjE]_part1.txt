I've been in crypto for 10 years. I think Ethereum is the right balance between decentralization and pragmatism. And I think building things that people can use are an underrated thing in crypto. I think a lot of people tend to focus on the ideology, which is important. But what I showed up to work at Coinbase and now what I'm doing with Forkaster is I want to build a protocol that has a billion plus people using it, but I want to do it in a way that doesn't compromise on the decentralization and the sovereignty at the user account level. Maybe it's a fool's errand, but that's what we're trying to do. Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more bankless. Do we really need decentralized social media? Our guest today, Dan Romero, says yes, and he explains why. We talk about the rise of decentralized social networks. A few takeaways for you in today's episode. Number one, why Dan thinks social media isn't broken, uses a different term. And we discuss what he means by that and why. And number two, we talk about what's new with decentralized social media. Why should people actually care about this? Not the hardcore crypto people who love decentralization, but the normal people, the masses. Number three, we talk about how decentralized a social media network actually has to be in order to work. What should be on chain and what doesn't need to be on chain. Number four, we talk about why a protocol, not a company, is really the way forward. And finally, we conclude the conversation about how all of this will fundamentally change the internet and the trajectory of humanity. David, what should listeners pay attention to this episode? Dan Romero is of course building Farcaster, but I think he also really just lays out the blueprint for any decentralized social media network, any protocol. And so while this is under the context of Farcaster, I think whatever decentralized social network does emerge out of the Web3 space, it's largely going to be synonymous with the blueprint, the map that Dan has laid out in this episode. And so I think this episode, I think it's actually going to be relatively timeless. Even if Farcaster for some reason doesn't see success, some other social media decentralized protocol will eventually, and it will largely follow the same blueprint that Dan lays out in this episode. So I think that's really the thing to pay attention to is, as you are listening to this, understand what primitives will be true no matter what flavor of social media protocol comes out of this space. Because I think if you're bullish on this space, you are certainly bullish that eventually one will come out. Maybe it's Farcaster, maybe it's a few others, maybe it's others we haven't heard about, but they're largely going to follow some of the same primitives and same first principles that were communicated on this episode. In the debrief, David and I are going to discuss what we think about our experience with current decentralized social networks as well. So stay tuned if you're a premium member, you can click right into that debrief.

Bankless Nation talking about decentralized social networks today with Dan Romero. Here's the co-founder of Farcaster, which is a new decentralized social network that's captured the attention of many in Web3. There are a few platforms competing for our attention these days, and Farcaster is certainly one of them. We're going to talk all about that today. And Dan, it's great to have you. Welcome to Bankless. Thanks for having me. Okay, let's start here with the big question. What is broken about Web2? Why do we need Web3 social networks? Why can't we just be satisfied with the Web2 versions of these things? And how do we even improve on those versions in a crypto version of a social network? Well, maybe I'll start with the contrarian answer is I don't necessarily think Web2 is broken. I think it can be improved upon. And so if you kind of just take the history of the Internet, Web1, you have decentralized protocols, HTTP, SMTP, DNS. And if you wanted to put information online, you basically went, registered a domain, figured out a web host, put up a website, and then hope people would find you. Google made it a little bit easier. And then you kind of had with Web2 this explosion of user-generated content. And with that user-generated content, you got to a place where distribution became a lot easier, right? You could start a podcast, put it on the iTunes store, and then eventually on YouTube, use Twitter for that distribution, have a sub stack. And so you kind of have all these great publishing tools where you can reach a massive audience. And right, like the whole creator economy as a result of Web2 getting these platforms to scale and then allowing people who might be a little less tech savvy, but really want to go be entrepreneurial and build an audience like yourselves to get to a really large scale. But as that scale happened, we went from kind of this, the classic nag on Twitter in the early days was, it's just a bunch of people saying what they ate for breakfast and then kind of call it around, I don't know, 2017, 2018, it was a threat to democracy. And so it's kind of a pretty big jump in a 10-year period to go from kind of a bunch of nerds talking about what they had for breakfast to, this is going to foundationally change the way our society is run. And I think with that kind of growing importance in society and just by function of having billions of people using all of these Web2 services every day, we're starting to see some of the limitations of kind of having a single platform be, for example, the public square on the internet, if you want to describe Twitter like that. It makes it really difficult when you have a global audience and a global user base to have a group of people in San Francisco, whether it's the public version of Twitter or a Twitter owned by Elon Musk, making decisions that impact how discourse, speech, communication happens globally. And I think where we sit now is, I think people from across the political spectrum, I think for the last few years, it was almost kind of like hardcore crypto people were interested in decentralization, and then there was this kind of branding that the only people interested in new social networks were kind of like right wing people who had been de-platformed from a Twitter. But I think quickly we've seen with Elon taking over, there's a whole new group of people who are all of a sudden being like, hey, I should be able to post a link to a Mastodon post and not have it be censored. And so I think people are reevaluating some of this stuff from first principles and realizing, hey, there are other protocols out there on the internet today that we use that are decentralized, permissionless, the web and email being two really important ones. I mean, Substax is a great example of a Web2 company built on top of a decentralized protocol, email. And so I think what we're hoping to do with Forecaster is marry the kind of decentralized and permissionless protocols of Web1 with the usability, convenience, ease of use that Web2 has ushered in that billions of people around the world are now able to create user generated content online and kind of participate. And so I think if you can marry the two of those things together, then you have a superior system. So I think what you're saying is the distinction that you're making when I use the term broken to maybe characterize Web2, you're sort of toning that down. You're saying, well, not broken in that we need to do a wholesale rip and replace, but there are fundamental areas of improvement. So not broken, but improvement. And I think maybe this is kind of semantics between the idea of something broken, the idea of something needing to be improved. But I think what you're saying is don't throw out the baby with the bath water here. There are some fundamental things that Web2 did correctly, namely getting the use case right. And what we actually need to do is figure out a way to improve on all of the flaws. If we were to look at some of the flaws with Web2 right now, I think you sort of hinted at a few of them. But this notion of Web2 going to a place where Twitter going to a place where it was basically doing nothing to it was destabilizing our democracy. Wow, that happened very quickly. And so that's one thing that people point to. Another thing is bots are everywhere. There's no concept of no notion of good identity or human based identity. Another of course, as you kind of alluded to this, is it's very controlled. That means it's very censorable. I don't have the ability to kind of own my own Twitter profile and my social graph. It's basically the property of Twitter. And I feel somewhat like a peasant on someone else's feudal land. So maybe these are the things. Is that list what you would point to as the improvement areas? And I guess my question is, how does Web3 help any of that? And does it actually help any of that? Yeah, so I think all of those points that you made are accurate and things that Web3 can improve on. But the way I describe Farcaster is there are two foundational principles that we are trying to achieve, and they solve two different problems. So the first is more for someone who has an audience, right? You have an audience with this podcast. You rely on Web2 platforms, which give you, again, massive distribution, ability to get your word out. But you don't own your audience on, I'd say, most of those platforms. Substack being a rare example where if you're using a platform like YouTube, you could have built up 10 million followers over five years. And on an arbitrary whim, no matter what the reason, they can turn your account off and you have no ability to get kind of like one last export of those subscribers. They have, by the way, Dan. I don't know if you're aware of this, but on Mother's Day of last year, YouTube shut down bankless. I thought you were going to say that they let you export the subscribers. Wow, that's a pretty pioneering thing. Nope. They shut us down. The worst one. Yeah. And so what do we do? We go into no word, no word of warning, just an email, a friendly email from some bot somewhere that says, your account shut down. And there was no kind of escalation process. And the only thing we could do, Dan, at that time was to get real loud on other social media platforms and say, look what Twitter, look what YouTube did to us. Which was only a luxury that we really had because other accounts were shut down that same day that didn't have the same sort of like feed following that we were able to invigorate to get the attention of YouTube. Yeah. So I apologize for interrupting you, but this happens. It happens in crypto. It happens in other communities as well. So go on. Well, yeah, I guess I don't need to sell you on this, but the idea that you could have built up this audience, generate a lot of revenue for whatever platform, and with the snap of a finger, it's gone. There is no arbitration. There is no get in front of a judge and make your case. Instead you get an automated support email treating you no different than one of the kind of like CZ spam bots on Twitter. I think that is unacceptable in a world where creators are real businesses and this is your livelihood. And so contrast that to email where if for whatever reason you decided to not work with Substack or Substack didn't want to work with you, it would be ludicrous if they held your emails hostage. Right? And part of that is just a norms thing, right? Email pre-existed a lot of these Web2 platforms. The idea that if you have an email newsletter, you own your newsletter subscriber list is just kind of that's what the market forces. Whereas I think with these Web2 platforms, because they've been so attractive from providing distribution and scale, they've been able to get away with not allowing a kind of publisher or a creator to own their audience directly. And so I think the foundational to Farcaster is you own your relationship with your audience. And actually it's not even quite that because it's your audience owns the relationship with you, right? So if someone follows you on Farcaster, it's not like somehow you now can kind of go ping them. They've actually opted into following you. But the important thing is no third party can come in and say, sorry, these two adults cannot decide to connect with each other over the internet. So that's on the creator publisher side. I think that the second thing that's really important, and maybe I'm dating myself here, but I remember when Twitter was a very open API and had a flourishing ecosystem of apps. And a lot of people don't even know a lot of the core features of Twitter were invented A, by Twitter users and B, first adopted in third party clients. So app replies, hashtags, quote tweets, retweets, those were all conventions within the 140 character tweet box. And then you had clients like Tweetbot, Twitterific, Tweety inventing, okay, this is how you natively handle it. And for the first few years, Twitter didn't even have a mobile client. They actually acquired the app called Tweety, which invented pull to refresh. So all of the apps that use pull to refresh today, you actually use a patent that Twitter owns and has decided to not generously not prosecute against. And anytime you use pull to refresh in an app that was invented by a third party developer on Twitter's API. And then roughly around 2014, they basically shut that down. They needed to make money on advertising. And it's very difficult to do that in a kind of third party app ecosystem. And actually more timely, as of I think like last week, they just turned off third party apps, right? They've kind of existed in this like weakened state for the last 10 years. But now like I don't think Tweetbot works, like they just shut it off overnight. And again, no communication. These are people building businesses, even in this kind of like weird world where Twitter never really liked their API. And another prominent example from the previous era was Facebook had an open platform. Pre-mobile, it was kind of like all these games and all these things that are built on top of it. Django was a company that basically built this entire business on Facebook. And then in a very short period of time, they kind of said, hey, this is deprioritized, tough luck, like, go find a new way to build out these games. And so those two examples from that era changed, I think, a lot of developers' opinions on I'm not going to go build a business or make a serious investment in a platform, knowing that you can have the rug pulled out from under them. And so I think with Farcaster, very much inspired by Ethereum and my time in crypto, it's you need to build a platform that hits a bar that is truly permissionless, both on the access to the data and the APIs to the system working so that as a developer, if you want to go build a client, I, as one of the early people building the actual protocol, shouldn't have a say what client can be built, just like Ethereum, right? I want to go build a competitor to Metamask. There's not some approval process that said, well, Metamask was the first wallet or one of the first wallets, so we're going to actually decide whether wallets can come in. A rainbow Coinbase wallet, you know, anyone can go build a wallet on top of a network like Ethereum. And I think that makes Ethereum stronger for it. So that's the other bar we want to hit with Farcaster. So you own your own audience or that relationship belongs to you. And as a developer, your relationship with your users and the data, completely permissionless. I think that was a really great exploration into some of the shortcomings of the current Web2 world. And Dan, I know that you said there's not much broken about Web2. There's only things that we can learn and build upon. But I think in your answer just now, a answer to the question of what's broken about Web2 is actually kind of like the shareholder equity incentive structure, because that's what created a bunch of monopolistic tendencies that you just listed out from Twitter and Facebook, where Twitter began as a very open ecosystem with APIs to enable third party creators. And due to what Twitter is, a Web2 company, any sort of thing of value that got built by somebody else was simply absorbed into Twitter. And eventually that aggregation and centralization and monopolization created the Twitter, the closed form of Twitter that we see today. And same thing with Zynga and Facebook. So maybe to answer what's broken about Web2 is actually like the traditional equity structure that a lot of these normal companies are kind of built into. And so I want to ask a question like, we can ask the question, what's broken about Web2 and what does Web3 do to fix this? I want to ask this in a slightly different way. There's a very early implementation of Ethereum was Peepeth, which was Twitter on Ethereum, where we could just say, oh, we can make Twitter, but Web3. We'll take Twitter, we'll copy and paste it and we'll put it on Ethereum. And then boom, we have decentralized Twitter. That really never took off. But maybe under a farcaster kind of structure that might be able to work. But there's one aspect of this conversation, which is how can we just take.
