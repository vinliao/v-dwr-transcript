case, I shifted over to this kind of gimmicky DM me if you want an invite. So no, like, yeah, but here's the thing. So the average person is like, oh, that's, that's never going to scale. Right. So I already did something that didn't want to scale the zoom calls. Then I said, DM me on Twitter, which, you know, RIP my inbox. But what was interesting about it is there's a little bit of friction and proof of work. And Twitter actually has this really interesting thing. And I started to follow more people on Twitter within crypto Twitter is I can see the mutuals and you could quickly see people who, oh, interesting. So it's like 80 people I'm following also follow this person. I don't even know who this person is, but that seems kind of interesting. And so could start to filter a little bit of like, okay, in a world where I'm doing a little bit more top of funnel marketing rather than sales, how can I continue to grow the network with some amount of quality? And that that strategy took probably like several hundred tweets of me on a regular basis being like, if you want an invite to Forecaster, or it's like, whatever the thing of the day would be. I'd post something about Forecaster or an idea and be like, if you're interested in this, please DM me. And sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn't. And it's just like the persistence of that over, you know, call it nine months of like, I just would wake up every day. And that's what I'm starting my day with is just managing my Twitter DM, DM inbox. And so we're finally getting out of that world. Like I'm doing about a lot less because now we have user driven invites. And so we're at 10,000 users now. And I think so for me to think about, it's like, okay, how do we get from 10,000 to 100,000 that's actually an unsolved problem for us. And so we're actually in the process of figuring it out right now. We're going to try a bunch of things. And hopefully I can come back a year from now and tell you, it's like, this is the thing that we did from the 10,000 to 100,000. That still is effectively sales and marketing. It's just you have to shift your tactic when you're doing a new order of magnitude. Yeah, that's interesting. I, having done a little bit of research for the episode, realize that, you know, you are laser focused on the kind of core web three audience, right? You're not trying to onboard new people to web three as quickly as you're trying to provide people in web three, a platform or a client or an app, however you want to phrase it, to go and communicate with other people who are interested in the space. Do you see that kind of shifting from 10 to 100,000? I know it's a little early, but. I don't think so. To 100,000, I think we can still be in quote crypto Twitter world. And so people who like our target audience, even up to 100,000 and maybe beyond that, they haven't met a mask already. Like use that as a simple proxy. Right. And so you can kind of look at some of the stuff like ENS is over a million unique addresses. Yeah, there's probably some dupes there, but even if you just say, okay, on average, everyone has two, then it's still 500,000 potential people who were sophisticated enough to go get an ENS. So I think orders of magnitude, 100,000, we're well within the realm of like someone who's what I would call crypto savvy. Right. So we started the 10,000, I think are like the most, you know, kind of bleeding edge. These people live and breathe crypto, whereas that next 90,000 people are people who are curious enough, especially in kind of maybe the mania of 2021, where they kind of wanted to play around with an ENS or NFTs or things like that. So that's what we'll be focused on. Are you guys going, I mean, is there any ideas around like partnerships to kind of grow like with specific like Web3 or crypto communities? I think it's an area we'll experiment with. I think the challenge there is, okay, so I have a discord. Let's say I have a really engaged discord of 5,000 people, 10,000 people. I go and say, hey, do you want to onboard that entire discord to Farcaster? So first of all, a bunch of those people, if it's like, you know, you think of this as actually a relatively small community of very active people, they're already on Farcaster. Okay. So now you onboard the rest. Are those people now going to be using Farcaster or are they going to continue to use the discord that they've already invested time in? And this is actually a problem we have had to confront and solve at least each amount of scale that we've reached is that there's this kind of framework I love to think about when building a consumer product is stated versus reveal preference. And the best example of this is Henry Ford's famous quote, if I had asked my customers what they want, they would want a faster horse. And so I think the kind of way to think about it is people actually don't really know what they want sometimes. Like in certain instances, yes. Like if it's like a very like well-defined thing, but with new technology and new products, it's your job to actually come up with the product and then be able to actually solve it with the consumer by maybe having an insight into like what their problem is or what the revealed preference of kind of like what they will use or do. But stated versus reveal preference is also something where people like to tell you what they think you want to hear. Like it's just natural human behavior. You go on board, you're 400 people in crypto having worked in crypto for almost a decade. And you're like, hey, check this out. You've said you're really interested in decentralized social, like it's imperative that we get there. Like you're really pro web three and crypto. That's the stated preference. The reveal preference of all these folks is they've got tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of Twitter followers that they worked really hard to build that audience. Why would they go spend any amount of time on a new protocol where they might have a hundred followers, right? Outside of like pure ideological alignment, which there are a few people in the world like that, but actually very few. The reveal preference is what people, people have a limited amount of time. So what they're going to do is they're going to use where they have their biggest audience. Until by the way, at some point they might lose that audience because they get banned from Twitter. And then they're riled up of like, wait, I wish I had actually been building this kind of in a protocol where maybe I can control it. And so where I think what we've found is the reveal preference of users is to find the people who don't have as much invested in another platform, whether that's Twitter or YouTube or discord and actually kind of target them. And when they start to build an audience on Farcaster where they now have more followers or kind of an audience size that's bigger on Farcaster than they have on a legacy platform, they've converted to becoming like a full Farcaster maxi in the sense that this is now more valuable to them than that other platform. And my friend Eugene Wei has an amazing essay. It's very long, but it's worth reading. Status as a Service. That actually specifically calls this point out where you can almost think of it as, and it's like a rough analogy that is like immigration, right? So it's like if you're in the upper class or the nobility of the original country, you probably don't have as much incentive to leave. Whereas if you're kind of like at the bottom of the hierarchy in terms of status or economics or whatever, you're more inclined to say, hey, maybe I'll move to the US, like that's land of opportunity, right? Like the new thing. And when you get there, you start out like everybody else. But as you build status in that new area, then you actually, it's a much more dynamic environment where now you can actually become one of the larger creators on this platform. And so Eugene talks about TikTok in the sense that each new big social media platform mints a new set of stars. And so I think we're in the early stages of that with Forecaster, but we have several people who have 5, 7,000 followers now on Forecaster having just a result of having been there early and active that is much bigger than their Twitter following. And so this becomes their default place to do distribution, which if there's some semblance of quality there can actually maybe kickstart a little bit of a flywheel where now other people are like, oh, these people are actually kind of interesting. I'm going to actually start using Forecaster because it's differentiated content and a graph than what I would get on Twitter. And so that's, I think, where it's taken us a while to get there with a bunch of mistakes in between, but like figuring out like the reveal preferences, find the people that traditional social media is underserved, but potentially are diamonds in the rough, and then actually get them to start using Forecaster and highlight that content and stuff like that. And so that's effectively what we've done over the last two and a half years. And if I think about like what we need to do over the next year, it's basically scaled up significantly. And so there will be probably a new set of tactics that we need to think about. So you've got kind of the, I guess, the stated versus revealed preference of the creators, right? The people that want to build a following, but just as important to those people are the people that want to be the voyeurs that engage in additional conversations that help add to those follower counts. Because let's be real, like creators don't always follow each other, right? Like they're trying to build their own fiefdom, if you will. What have you, have you done any exploration around that side or is that just so secondary just to get the good quality content onto Forecaster and content creators? What is that? So we've actually been pretty explicit. We have very limited set of algos in terms of like, if you just think of it as like, we have a following feed, which is kind of reverse chronological, but then we have something called highlights. So if you're familiar with TikTok or even, or Twitter, like the for you is effectively the algo and then following is more traditional for you following. And then we have a recommended set of users. And what we've done early on is we haven't done machine learning. It's actually just been heuristic based in terms of like what algo rules. And we explicitly try to reward people who are actively having conversations. So here's an example. I post really good tweets or memes or whatever. I show up on Forecaster. I just start automatically cross-posting, right? Cause I'm just like, okay, this is quality content. I'm going to go post it here. So two things happen. One, I use Forecaster, but I also see it on Twitter. I'm like, okay, this like, what is differentiated about this? And there's all this other stuff on Twitter. So like I should just use it on Twitter. So that actively hurts the value of the network. The second thing is if you are posting and people are actually in good faith, especially cause the network is smaller, are wanting to engage and then you don't reply, that hurts the value of the network. And so what we've really tried to emphasize is, so if you post and it gets a bunch of likes, but you're not really engaging or there's not a lot of conversation, the algo does not value that as much as a post that gets a lot of back and forth conversation. And so it's not overly complicated in terms of the algo. You can kind of think about it. But the whole point is we would rather highlight things that generate like back and forth on the network, real conversation, then kind of this broadcast and then try to hope for likes. Whereas Twitter doesn't do that. Twitter is, and I'm overly simplifying this, but like if you just think of their algo and their incentives, up until Elon, it was time spent because time spent means you see more ads and if you see more ads, they make more money. So time spent, if you just let the machine learning algorithm at scale go after that, it's naturally going to surface threads. So you have all these like, it's like, yeah, and it's like, you could have condensed this into like three tweets or one tweet. You turn it into 10 because now if I click through and I like kind of go through and I'm like, okay, get to your point, get to your point, get to your point. I am spending more time on that set of tweets, which if the algo's goal is to increase time because that increases revenue, then that's what you get. And so if you kind of think about Twitter, it is very, very broadcast and like people actually don't engage. Like, if you just look at like big crypto Twitter accounts, they don't really respond to their comments. And there's a whole bunch of other reasons like spam and like, you know, all this other kind of crap that Twitter hasn't figured out. But at a core, very few people are actually having conversations. They are broadcasting to their audience. And the other thing that Twitter has, which we haven't really implemented because we want to be careful about this, is what quote tweets do is if just think about the conversation you'd be having. So let's say you and I are having an exchange on Twitter and someone who doesn't like us comes in and quote tweets. Okay. That would be the equivalent of us having a conversation at a party, that person walking up and then screaming out to the rest of the party, hey, everyone, look how idiotic these people over here are, like by taking one tweet out of context, which if you think about it, like most people are not going to click through to that tweet. They're just going to see the like thing out of context with the dunk. And then like the dunk is, you know, ratio, like think of all these terms that we have from Twitter. And it's a function of, it's become a product and a network where it's very much about broadcasting to your tribe and your team. And so I think that with what we have, granted, we're way smaller, we don't have a bunch of these issues. You can't sign up just like out of the box. So Twitter is actually at a, like relatively for a centralized network, a permissionless state. So we want to give them intellectual honesty, like credit there. But the thing that we have an ability to do is because we don't have this ad driven model, is maybe we can actually shift the incentives and the core primitives and behavior on the network to be more oriented towards conversations by our choices and how we do an algo or kind of incentives on the network. And I think we're still trying to figure that out, that maybe it doesn't ever get as big as Twitter in, you know, maybe the next couple of years, but the quality of conversation is so much higher that that quality starts to attract other people to actually want to be the audience, right? Because quality is super hard to fake. And I think the thing that we're going to actually find out is the GPT revolution, as it applies to Twitter threads, I think is going to get so bad. Like in the same way that SEO got really bad. But like I think like the kind of threader GPT thing, it's like, here's the story of the day. GPT is now going to be able to, you know, take all this information in and do a 20 long thread and pull the... Just take any threader that you want is like, I'm pretty sure an LLM is going to be able to do that. And so then it's just Twitter is going to be overrun with it. I would imagine they're going to have to change the algo because it'll actually, people will start to use the app less. And what people will be craving is authentic conversations. And it's like, oh, this is like a one to one exchange between two people that, yeah, maybe it's LLM supported to like make it a little wittier. But the idea is like a one to one back and forth between two public people on a platform is like, that's actually what makes Twitter interesting. Obviously, it tends to be more negative, but like that's the opportunity I think for us in the near term with Mark Guster. I love that. I mean, I have, I don't know, have you been following Tim Urban's new book that just came out at all? I haven't had a chance to read it. I know he was working on it and then he apparently had their kid a little early. So like that was not originally part of the plan. But yeah, tell me about the book. Yeah, no, I've started the book. I have listened to five and a half hours of podcast of him talking about the book with Lex Friedman and Patrick O'Shaughnessy over on the best like the best. And it just the core concept is that there is low rung thinking, which is what we're kind of in as a society right now, which are these echo chambers. And a lot of the algorithm on Twitter is feeding these echo chambers. Right. And then there is high rung thinking, which is what he calls an idea lab, which means that we are having open, honest discourse about ideas and nobody is demonizing you for having a difference of opinion. When I think of what you are talking about, prioritizing for high quality conversations, I think you are promoting idea labs. Right. Whereas when I spend a lot of my time on Twitter and I scroll through and I see six different people posting a thread about the greatest prompts and chat GPT. And let me tell you about the secrets and ins and outs of the SVB bank failure. You know, it's it begins to get repetitive. Right. And like, you don't really get to have good conversations, because like you said, there's not a lot of incentive for the people with big followings to continue a conversation. It's more of an incentive to just broadcast it. Now, that doesn't mean that they're going to get demonized to the sense where what he calls a social justice fundamentalism, which is the woke culture. But I mean, I just there to be able to do something like that, to have more of a dinner party conversation than a podcast, even though obviously I'm a big fan of podcasts. Right. Like we are broadcasting this. I'm not in the in the chat talking to people and asking them, what do you think of what Dan just said? Right. But like, if you can do stuff like that, that's very high quality content. And I feel like from what you've just said, that's what you're trying to do. Right. Is create that space for people. And right now, people that are associated with crypto Twitter and Web3 to have those high quality conversations. And you've got that, by the way, you've got all the big names, in my opinion, already on there having the conversation. So I just I find that intriguing. And I think it's just totally on point with what he calls a self-help book for society. Right. This is what we need more of. Yeah. Yeah. And it's an interesting concept. I should I should check out the book. I think a couple of things. So, one, I actually have a contrarian take on filter bubbles. I actually think that they're completely OK if you can actually generate the idea lab content for tribe X or tribe Y in public, because then you can actually exchange those ideas even if you're not necessarily having a direct conversation, because that tends to be less civil. So imagine just a hypothetical scenario in a couple of years here where there are two major clients on top of Farkaster or decentralized social protocol. Right. And let's assume that we're all in kind of like one global commons for social protocol. And you have team yellow and team green, and they each have very different politics. OK. When you use team yellow's client, you don't see anything from team green. Like so if someone from team green at the protocol level responds with a quote dunk or whatever, and it's like, look at this idiot or like blah, blah, blah, like tech bro like this or like, you know, like blah, blah, woke person or like whatever. It's just all of that vitriol. You just don't see it. So what ends up happening is team yellow. Remember, all this is public, by the way, is having their conversation and stuff here. And team green can go read that content if they want, maybe a different client or whatever, and then vice versa. And so you're going to have those like low rung thinking people who just all they want to do is actually fight online. Like it's just entertainment. Like that's actually what they're there for. But you're going to have the higher rung people be able to actually at least engage in those ideas. And this does happen on Twitter today. It just gets drowned out. And so a really basic example of this is Noah Smith. He has no opinion on Substack. Like he kind of used to be within, I think, academia and or like traditional media. Now he's independent on Substack. And I think he's doing from a financial standpoint, probably better than he's ever done traditionally in any of that stuff. So now he has a direct line to his audience. I personally don't agree with a lot of what Noah says. I think he's generally a little bit more left than I am on the spectrum. But what's fascinating about Noah is he in good faith intellectually engages with basically every topic that he writes. And I find myself whenever I'm reading Noah, having to question my own set of beliefs because he's presenting in a logical and coherent argument. And so I think what ends up happening is if you can allow people to actually just express those ideas and engage in kind of whatever way they want, and somehow you can highlight the kind of higher rung thinking, even if we disagree, you're actually getting to an intellectual environment that's, I think, a lot more idealized. And the beauty of it is you just can drown out all the low rung thinking. And that can actually be a decision at the client level. So you can imagine you have that yellow client and the green client, and then someone chooses, I don't know, like the purple client over here. And the purple client just basically says, we're actually going to try to get the people from using AI, like super negative ad hominem attacks or whatever. We're just going to drown those people out. Or just like they're using like swear words or whatever.
