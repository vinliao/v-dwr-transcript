in a way that allows for the permissionless innovation and those strong guarantees I gave you before about like what makes a protocol great. So I guess just to push on that a little bit further, I'd sort of take what you've just said there. Sounds to me that the expectation is that most people will probably actually participate in Farcaster through the Farcaster client. You know, you are putting a ton of time and thoughtful design into this product. And so, and that if we sort of look at where maybe the stated preference that for users who are feel like they are current, say Twitter or YouTube social network landscape, isn't a space where they are able to be themselves for whatever reason, they say they wanna leave and go somewhere else. In reality, those places they go to are really like far inferior, not just from a technical perspective, but also like all the people who don't wanna hang out on Twitter, put them in one room, probably not a room I wanna go hang out in. And I don't think most people there would want to either. And so I guess just to get back to my point earlier, like why build this decentralized if you think that ultimately people are just going to use it through the main client? Yeah, so I think it will be like that for a while until it's not. I don't have like a specific threshold. I think it generally think in order of magnitude, so we have 4,500 people in a beta today. So somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000, maybe someone says, hey, this is worth my time to go build a competing client, even though that team has spent multiple years thinking about it and I maybe can learn some things. Maybe I clone what they've done and just kind of iterate on the edges. I think when you get to the 100,000 to a million people on the network, it becomes even more compelling to say, you know what, I actually think like it's worth it, even though that there's another funded team. Like I just have better ideas. I think that this is an underserved area. And then obviously if you get to a million to 10, like it just gets bigger and bigger. And so I think it can be simultaneously true where it's like, there's no point in competing with them. And then at the same time, it's actually, it's like, that's the massive opportunity. And I think we just have to be really focused on is one, holding up the ideals of the protocol where I gave you those two examples where it's like you really, as a user, if you want to switch to another client, you're going to continue to have all the same access to the audience that you built, right? So that actually encourages you to switch to another client. Simple example, I have a Gmail address. I don't switch from Gmail to other providers to even test them out because changing my email, even if I did forwarding, it just like, it's kind of a pain. Whereas if you use G Suite and you had your own domain, that actually becomes a little bit easier to do that, right? I think a second example on the developer side, and we're already starting to see this, people want features in the main client, our client. And we're saying like, hey, sorry, not a priority. So like a basic example of this one is GIFs and video and audio. People are really clamoring for that. We are a team of six. We have a lot of other stuff that we're trying to get done, probably not going to happen. And so like I could imagine someone building a much more rich multimedia oriented client. And I actually casted this recently saying, someone should just build a client that's really focused on music, right? People on Forkaster, it's a revealed preference. People are actually sharing links to music. They share links to YouTube music. People ask for music recommendations. They have music NFTs that are showing up in their wallets. You could make that client and it could be a team of one or two people, right? And you don't have to go raise a ton of money for that or whatever. And then the nice thing is the protocol is actually doing a lot of work for you, right? It's verifying all the posts, it's making sure all the identities are set up. So you've actually in some ways reduced the overhead that you need to do to bootstrap it. And you can use the main Forkaster client as your primary source of distribution. Hell, if you built that client, I probably am going to recast it and say, hey, look at this cool new Forkaster client. And so can you deterministically guarantee that we won't go evil? No, like it's not an intellectually honest answer, but I'm gonna continue to come on podcasts, say it on Forkaster everywhere. It's like the reason I'm working on this is I actually wanna build the protocol and I view it as a huge success. If we actually get to scale, where today we have 99% of client usage on the network. If we get to a point where you have a hundred million people using the network every day and we have 10% market share, that to me is a resounding success. Like that's something I can point back to and say, I actually helped build that. And I really believe that there is a way to thread the needle there. That said, if I put on the skeptics hat, there is no way that I wouldn't be skeptical listening to someone like myself on the, hey, I've watched every web two company say that they were gonna do this, and then they've turned around and screwed people over. And so that's just the reputation we have to earn. And there was an interesting conversation on Forkaster this weekend, where I was like kind of thinking through a product feature because I've been using more of Twitter's features just to kind of grok. Like traditionally I only followed a hundred people. Now I follow 2,500, I'm algo maxi now just to kind of understand all that. And the get notified when someone tweets feature. I posted that out, seemed like a lot of people are interested. And then I had a developer who rightfully was like, hey, I actually built this other tool. Well, like, should I stop working on it? And so I ended up having a really thoughtful offline conversation with this person. And I think we got to a good place of like understanding what he was trying to build and like what we were thinking about here. But I think it's like, there are gonna be hard situations where we need to figure that out. In the Apple parlance, it's called Sherlocking, where there's this kind of app that used to be what now is Mac OS Finder called Sherlock, right? Like look for your files. And since that app got killed by Apple making the first party, every year at WWDC, there's some set of apps that now kind of gets folded into the overall ecosystem. Like people forget like the flashlight app used to be a thriving ecosystem of like power flashlight apps that just basically turned your screen white before they even had the physical flash. So I think like we're never gonna be perfect on this, but I think we need to do our best to be a steward of the protocol while at the same time doing what I think is the single biggest service to the protocol is with our client, growing the number of addressable daily active users for the protocol. And if you actually think about Apple, that is the single most important thing that they do for the iOS ecosystem is sell iPhones, which are daily active by virtue of you or have it physically attached to you in your pocket. And people deal with the app store and all of the ring of morale, you know, the 30% cut, the like, you know, not allowing NFTs and all this other stuff, not because that's great, it's because it makes distribution for what they built like really easy. And so I think that that is the overarching thing that we really need to do is just continue to grow daily active users, not monthly, not signups, it's daily active. Because that means if you have someone who has an app on the home screen, that is someone who's now potentially gonna go check out another app in the ecosystem. And so that is the thing that we are trying to get in front of developers is like, hey, like we have real people, not spam bots. They're using the app basically every day. So you have as much of a shot at getting them to install your music client or something like that. I don't know if that answers your question. It's just something we're thinking about. And like, I think it's a really good critique of like the practical reality of where we are today, where we have one client that represents 99% of the usage of the network. It's like, we have to get that down over time if the protocol is gonna be successful. Yeah, I mean, I think it's fascinating to me because you know, I joined Twitter in 2007. And I think like my first graduated university came out just as the promise of social media was becoming a thing. I was an early blogger user and WordPress user and sort of this idea of democratizing media was the thing that was just so compelling. And I had run a small business before and I was like, the internet changes all of this. And then, you know, earlier than most really came up against the challenges of aggregation and centralization and sort of the business models ultimately that live in a Twitter more so in a Facebook and a YouTube. And so, and I think in the example earlier that, you know, I remember when Twitter had this thriving developer ecosystem. It felt like anybody could go and launch anything and have a shot at not only the core premise of Twitter being like, you can have your voice heard by anybody, but you could also have your tool or your startup. There's just like a lot more energy. And it's why I love crypto so much. I feel like that energy is here again in this new space. But the sort of closing down of the API was very much a business driven decision, right? It's an advertising business. I think they started to see a number of other clients get rolled up as somebody who's trying to go build a competing advertising business. And very much the incentives lived within, you know, Twitter Corp to close that down. And so I guess my question for you is like, how are you thinking about the business model or the economic model of Farcaster? And so far as it supports this grand vision that you're laying out. Yeah. So protocol and client. Let's talk about protocol for a second. In Farcaster V1 kind of had an identity primitive that was just a username. And there were a couple of issues with that. So in a decentralized follow model, if you tie all follows to a username, if you as the user want to upgrade your username, so let's say I was Dan Romero and I wanted to switch to DWR or D, I wouldn't be able to upgrade my username because I would need to then go get all of my followers. Imagine now you have multiple clients to go re-sign that follow. And so naturally we moved to a model where what is what you do with a centralized database is you have an ID number. So there's something called the Farcaster ID. It lives on chain. It's a one time, so just gas only fee. And it's just an integer that increments. So if you're the 33rd user on Farcaster, your FID is 33. So if you're old school, you remember ICQ where it just incremented every single number of user and that's fine. It's abstracted away from the user. It's how everything in the system works, but that's actually important because you can do it once and you can continue to use the network forever and never have to pay another thing. And so I think there's a little bit of friction there and a little bit of cost. We've actually built this kind of gasless onboarding so you don't even need any crypto to sign up and we'd cover the cost for you. I'd imagine over time, there are gonna be plenty of companies that are willing to kind of do that. But the nice thing is it also prevents a bunch of spam because if just by virtue of having to convince someone to pay for you, there's probably gonna be a little bit more verification or things like that. The optional component, and this is a hypothesis we're gonna test this, is if you're really into the Farcaster ecosystem, you just love using Farcaster apps and all these different clients, having a username that is this kind of specific to that ecosystem, which can also potentially unlock other benefits. And so one of the things is we have a decentralized storage network for all these posts. You can imagine the base level, if you have an FID, you get X amount of storage on the network. And then if you have a Farcaster username, you get more. We still need to actually kind of figure out how to like make that all work, but we have an idea on how to potentially go do that. And you can imagine some other kind of features that we could bundle in that over time. But actually its core premise, I just have this general belief that anywhere you spend a lot of time in a digital setting, you're actually willing to pay for cosmetic upgrades that kind of indicate that you're serious about status. And so give a couple of examples. So one, Fortnite, free to play game. People buy skins in that game for billions of dollars a year. Counter-Strike is another example. Doesn't actually make you a better player. Like it's just strictly a, hey, this is a little bit of flair. I think Reddit just showed an example of people are willing to buy collectibles and different things for flair. And I think that the third is, if you just kind of look at Twitter and what they're about to go through, I suspect that you're gonna see is a large number of people are gonna be willing to pay and maybe they'll have different grades of blue checks to solve for the people who want the, you know, I'm an important person. But I do think that there will be just like kind of a default where you just pay and it's like you get a little check and that's the default experience. Max me out. I want the most credit I can possibly get on Twitter. And I think that, yeah, I think you're a hundred percent right there. Right, so this is gonna be a stated preference. Oh, I don't want the check. Like this is stupid. Don't pay Elon. The reveal preferences is like, wait a second. I have a hundred thousand followers on this thing. If I don't have it, I'm gonna get knocked at the distribution. I'm gonna hold my nose, even if you don't like it and pay for it because what the deal here is, is like, if the game is everyone has a certain base level of status and that's how the default interactions are, that's the way it's gonna work. And so that's actually going directly to the protocol. It doesn't go to our company and that will go to a treasury for the protocol. And our view is over time, that should help the protocol be independent of any one company in the sense that you could imagine developers similar to Ethereum working for the protocol, probably some nonprofit. And that I think is an important thing for two reasons. So one, I think if you look at protocols like the web and email, yes, they're decentralized and it's like in theory, anyone can contribute. The reality is all the big corporations who run those big services dictate the de facto control of the networks, right? Contrast that something like Linux where it's one person, BDFL, but potentially experimenting with models there. I don't know. I think it could be pretty interesting. I think a second reason that it's useful is if people are willing to pay for something, then it's probably valuable, right? It's like by definition. And so you can imagine now if there's, I don't know, a hundred thousand, a million people who are willing to pay $10 a year to a protocol, I bet you that group of people on average is gonna be pretty high quality relative to the other social networks that exist out there. $10 is not gonna break the bank for most people. Yes, in developed countries versus developing countries is gonna have different connotations and maybe you can figure out differential pricing models or people are willing to sponsor that. But going back to the point is all you need is that FID is actually to be able to post. So it's not even like you necessarily need that. So that to me is important is actually build the muscle. Like don't pretend that you can monetize later. And I think we've seen some of this in DeFi where it's like, they're able to give tokens out, but then it's like, okay, actually, are any of these protocols gonna be able to collect fees? There's actually, I think one impressive thing about Maker is that they've actually generated revenue through stability like fees over time and from an early stage. And so I think that that's an important thing. I think I learned that at Coinbase, it's like get people to pay for things early on because that's actually gonna show you the reveal preference of consumers whether they actually value something or not. And then the second thing is on the client side, I think that there's a whole variety of options for monetization. And in our case, philosophically, just like something I'm interested in, but I also think it's the right dynamic for how I want the relationship between users and what I actually want our customers is instead of advertising, we are planning to monetize via kind of a freemium subscription model. So we will have a free tier, people can use our clients, and then we're gonna put some set of features behind a paywall. And if you're a more active and engaged user and you want these features, and hopefully we've come up with a set of features that are valuable, right? So otherwise people won't subscribe. And if they do, we shift the relationship between you being a Forecaster user and being the product, right? If you think about traditional social media, it's like time spent turns into ads watch, which turns into revenue. We can actually shift it to being a customer subscriber where our calculus changes. How do we increase time spent? Doesn't become the first thing. It's how do we provide more value to our customers and subscribers? And I think a great example of this is Amazon Prime, which started with free shipping. And then over time it got big enough that they said, hey, we're gonna add video in here because it'll make the Prime subscription more valuable. And I don't think we're adding video anytime soon. That's not the point. But the point is, is it changes the relationship between you and your users to being customers. And then I think it's your product decisions on the margin are about what's gonna actually increase something like NPS, right? So it's a customer satisfaction effectively for those who don't know what NPS is. But that is actually, I think a really powerful thing and a motive anything to be able to actually build products where people are willing to pay you for them. You actually wanna delight your users in a way that they were customers, right? I'm so programmed to say users because when you think of social media, you always say users, but if you can actually ship the customers, I think it's just a more pleasant way of, I don't know, building products. So I'm curious, my infatuation with crypto really came from this idea of having ownership in the networks that I'm building on. So, you know, being an early YouTube user or even Facebook user, building out and investing a lot of time, energy, creative heartbeats into creating a following or subscriber base there only to have that sort of removed as new monetization models or features are rolled out. It's kind of give me, I think, a very formative experience in my sort of way of looking at the world. And I think it's expanded since then. And I think there's to the point where I think like, maybe it's a bold statement, but the inequality that exists in the world right now in part, definitely in a small part is from this lack of owning the digital property that is incredibly valuable and powerful in coordinating our economy these days. So that's why Ethereum is just the most fascinating thing to me ever. That pulls through into all that we do at C-Club, the idea of community members, people contributing to the collective, having ownership or a say or governance in these things. So I'm curious how you're thinking about that. Is Farcaster going to be something that exits to community in the future? I see a few different pieces here that make that both exciting and probably fairly complicated. Yeah, the way I think about all this is I wanna prove that the hypotheses work in order before like, so just in from a sequence standpoint. So we kind of like wanted to prove first, will people even use the decentralized social protocol? We have 4,500 people using it. Metrics look good on that scale. It's a small social network today. We're gonna continue to try to grow that. So that is one that we have some early signs of like proof, but we wanna scale it a lot more. So that is still an ongoing thing. The second thing that we really wanna prove is are people willing to even pay for a username? Because we can have all these grand plans and maybe people are willing to do FIDs, which again, are one-time costs. And then most people are gonna be like, eh, no, I don't actually care about a Farcaster username or it's a very small number of people. Okay, well, so in that case, we need to actually think through is like, is there any value accrual to the protocol at all? And so you gotta actually figure out like what is the value there? There is another version, let's just hypothetically say no one wants to pay for usernames and we can't figure out anything for Farcaster the protocol to actually have a sustainable revenue. Just make that assumption. I don't believe that, but like, let's just like from an intellectual standpoint. Then we could say, okay, well, who controls the GitHub repo for the default implementation of the hub, right? Which if you think about Bitcoin, Bitcoin is technically controlled by miners, but very important to that is the like, I don't know, what is it, Bitcoin D or whatever that core piece of software that most ecosystem participants use. If that GitHub repo, which I think is like five people, it's like they need some quorum, changes the block size, like that effectively is gonna get propagated out, maybe the miners, but like, so there's a complex set of things there that play out. And so you gotta actually figure out, it's like, okay, what is the effect of the same way for this network that for example, increase the storage requirements for hubs that's gonna naturally make them more expensive, which will decrease centralization over time, which basically big companies will be able to kind of control it. How could you basically value that in terms of owning the rights to decide how that repo works? I think actually, to be totally honest, where we are today with GitHub is the primary place. It's a centralized company and it's where most people do the collaboration. And so this is actually, I'm not an investor, I just, I find it intriguing of like, can you actually move Git to a protocol that is actually very tied to like governance rights that are associated within cryptographic signatures and smart contracts and all that kind of stuff. And I think there's this company Radical that is trying to do Git that is more crypto native. I actually don't even know the latest on where they are, but you could imagine getting to a place where the commit that can actually flip that all of the core hubs that are for the most part, the practical reality is they're not gonna run their own custom, they're just gonna take whatever comes from the main repo, could actually move to a truly decentralized both data storage and control of what gets committed. So that could be interesting. And so I think that's how we wanna approach each step is have very high bar in terms of like what meets like intellectual rigor around like, is this actually worth putting a governance structure that is not gonna just be ceremonial. And so like, what I don't wanna is like announce this kind of like thing that we drew up on paper, only to then have it be like, well, practically the guy who has the GitHub key over there, regardless of what you say in this snapshot vote and on chain, like, and so that's actually one of the things I think is so interesting about nouns and I'm sure there are other, and maybe you can actually tell me about like other people doing this kind of stuff on chain, but this idea that they have an on chain treasury, there's an on chain active proposition voting governance system, and that people are building muscles, right? Because so many of these governance systems are just they don't get used enough, which means you run into this kind of like negative feedback loop that like, people are less interested or they don't.
