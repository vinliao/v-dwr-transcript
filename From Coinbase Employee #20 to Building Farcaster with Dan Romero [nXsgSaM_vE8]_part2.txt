Like it's not there. And the types of conversations you see having on those platforms are different than the conversations you have on the mainstream platforms, right? So I see it from like an information pocket point of view. Right? Another thing that's super interesting is like, I know you're big on history, right? And also the way you speak, I noticed like you referenced a lot of like learning lessons and insights that you sort of developed and picked up on like as you saw social media kind of develop. I'm curious, can you share more about like the history around the social graph, right? And if you build a web three social graph, like what sort of problems are you aiming to fix? Right? Big picture. What did web two social graphs do wrong that you think, yeah, like these more open permissionless protocols can do right? Yeah. So I actually don't think there's a ton of great reading out there. You kind of had to experience some of it. And I was fortunate that I was not super old yet, but I was in high school enough that I really got to see the full rise of web two social media. But the kind of things to think about are, you have the kind of early version of the internet, which was very much about read, right? So it's a kind of consuming information, weather information, sports scores, stocks. And then as the performance of browsers and broadband connections, you started to move to this kind of interactive model where you could effectively use a web application as in lieu of using desktop software, right? And as that happened, you had the kind of first wave of social networks, Facebook in 2004, Twitter, I think 2006, and a whole bunch of other ones that popped up. But what's interesting is in that era, the primary way of bootstrapping those social graphs outside of just people kind of friending each other on Facebook specifically because they went to school together. So that was actually gated on email. If you look at some of the growth tactics, this is what I've been told at least, that Facebook used, it was kind of the contact importer from your email address, right? It's like sign in with your Gmail or upload your contact list. And that in of itself kind of was able to create a pretty big graph. And what's interesting about that is, so let's say 10 of my friends had signed up for Facebook. And I show up to Facebook because I was in their contact book. Facebook actually had enough information to make a recommendation of here are some potential friends. And I think there's the kind of apocryphal story of get to the 10 friends is the magic number and then Facebook user. So that was the Facebook implementation is gate on email based on school, get concentration in those schools, expand out to other schools. And then eventually, once you have all the college students in the US, you can expand out to the rest of the world. And the thing I always like to kind of point out is if you think about it, Facebook stopped being cool the moment it stopped being only for colleges, but because they had created such a high concentration of very engaged users at a, I think a critical cool juncture for society, right? Everyone younger than a college student thinks they're cool because they're in college and then people who are graduated from college wish they were back in college. And so my theory on that is that that concentration of basically college students had this crazy half-life where even if college student engagement started to slowly decline on Facebook, it didn't matter because the rest of the world wanted to kind of go after that original feel. And then you eventually get to several billion people using that phenomenal success from building a social graph. Twitter a little different in that it was a little bit more SF tech scene. And the South by Southwest, and it kind of started actually as a slightly older platform relative to, if you look at a lot of social networks, they tend to be younger. And the push with Twitter is, if you actually look at it, it just didn't grow that much in the scheme of things for the first five years. And really it's only in the last five, seven years that it's had a significant, like really big impact on society. It really kind of run the 2016 election. I think Twitter became a lot more mainstream. Obviously always high status from the hashtag or the app reply, but in terms of Twitter being used as kind of this true internet public square, I think 2016 and after that's where Twitter, and then part of it is the president was using Twitter directly. And so I think that network, I don't have as much insight into exactly how the social graph developed, but that said, I also think one thing to think about with Twitter is Twitter is not a social network for most people who use it. I think on the order of 200 million people use Twitter every day. What percentage of people are actually tweeting, liking, replying, it's relatively small. Whereas I think most people use Twitter as an information feed and just simply a way to catch up on news. Whereas you or I, the way we use Twitter is this kind of intellectual thought leadership network where you're meeting other like-minded people in your industry to kind of have a better perspective on whatever you're working on. And that version of Twitter is what it started with, but really has not expanded. We didn't have a hundred million people all of a sudden doing threats on Twitter, right? And so that's actually something that's influenced our thinking with Farcaster is, if you actually think of the addressable market that you have to go after in order to be something that's competitive with Twitter, that total number of users of the 200 million people using it every day, that's a daunting number and it feels like you can never get there. But if you reframe it to say, actually the Twitter version that we're trying to compete with early on is go for the people who use Twitter as kind of this public intellectual social network. Then that's a far smaller number and it makes it more achievable, right? Like you go from being barely any way that the percentage of the way there to, okay, maybe you can get to like 0.1% and then to 0.5%, 1%, 10%. And so I think that is a way of reframing what we're going after. And the other interesting thing about people who use Twitter as a social network is they're the ones who hit the problems the most, right? They post about, you know, Metamask or the future of crypto wallets and then they get all the crypto spam responding to them, right? You take a lot of time to craft, whether it's a thread or a post for your podcast and for whatever reason, the algo is like, oh, you put a link, we don't want you clicking on the link because that kicks you out of the app. Okay, it gets downgraded. And so that is where I think the opportunity for a new social network, at least in the bootstrapping mechanism, it's to go after the people that feel the acute pain points of Twitter. But the challenge with those people, and I think we've talked about this on DM, is you're trying to build an audience. And so you're gonna optimize for the platform where you feel like you're gonna get the most reach. And so for something like Farcaster, where we're approaching it with this kind of very deliberate growth, invite only 3,000-ish people in a beta, it's gonna be hard to justify for you as a content creator to say, hey, I'm gonna spend more time on Farcaster because I really wanna build my audience if you feel like there's more potential on either another web-based social network or realistically something like Twitter. And it's actually an insight that when we launched Farcaster last year, I onboarded a whole bunch of people that I would call are my Twitter friends and people in my professional network. And they had talked a lot about, for a long time, about the need for a decentralized version of Twitter. And so I start working on this thing. I'm ready to onboard them. They go through an onboarding with me. They're really excited. They're like, wow, this is actually pretty decent. Never come back. And I reach out to them and ask, well, why didn't you come back? You told me that you thought this is an important thing. And whether they were willing to admit it or not, I think I finally figured out, and this is obvious in retrospect, but I think you sometimes have to just go through the hard lesson of it, is if you have 500,000 or 800,000 followers on Twitter and you have 80 followers on a nascent social network, how are you gonna justify spending the time on that network out of just pure passion or interest? But those people are busy. So of course they're gonna default to the thing that has massive distribution because ultimately if you're playing this kind of public intellectual social network game, what you care about is mean propagation and idea propagation. And so quantity does matter. Now, I think one thing I would say is quality has been very hard to measure traditionally. And I think one interesting thing about a decentralized social network that is crypto native like Farcaster is one, you can now have a whole bunch of competing companies have full access to the entire data set. So one thing about Twitter, like the proverbial fire hose, I think that that's pretty limited and who has access to it. I don't even know if they even give access to it at this point. But the idea is you can't actually do a full measure of the entire network. You have to do sampling. Whereas with something like Farcaster, you can genuinely, you can just actually index the entire network. And then what's interesting is you can also look at the on-chain activity. And so you can actually use that on-chain activity in two ways I think is interesting. Is one, you can quickly figure out if things look spammy, right? Because it's very expensive to put high value NFT or even $5,000 worth of Ethereum into a whole bunch of addresses to kind of fake an account. Whereas contrast that to a Twitter account, bot account where, I think a lot of times they just need a phone number which you can programmatically create with VoIP. And so I think that that becomes really interesting because you can actually start to measure the quality by whatever metric you want of your audience in a way that in Web2, you get a little bit of it like Facebook can have some centralized reporting tools, but it's pretty general and crude. Whereas I think you get a lot more detail with Web3 and maybe it doesn't always sit the same. Maybe we get a little bit more privacy on-chain in terms of what we're doing. But I think it's an underexplored area. And I think as we scale Farcaster, I do think people are gonna build some interesting tools so that you have a much better understanding of your audience. Building on a decentralized crypto native network like Farcaster, and yes, your audience might only be 10% or 1% of your audience on Twitter, but you have higher confidence that it's actually a higher value audience and an audience that might actually refer your podcast to another front, right? And so I think that's like one element that we're trying to figure out because it's just gonna be a really long time before we ever kind of reach the level of scale that Web2 social networks have. I'm curious, Dan, because I'm trying to figure out what does it mean to be a crypto native creator, let alone build an audience using Web3 primitives, right? So one thing that I've been experimenting with is giving out NFTs to my listeners as a way to kind of prove their participation across seasons, right? And over time, there's been thousands of NFTs that have been minted. And now I'm trying to use that information to create better content for them by seeing their activity on-chain so that I can find better sponsors, et cetera, find better guests. So if I notice that a lot of people have been, for example, collecting music NFTs, that tells me I should be having more music NFT related conversations. If I see a lot of activity around like Web3 social applications, right? Then I wanna have more Web3 native social conversations, right? Hence why I did like this season on like Web3 social media, data, like interoperability, et cetera, right? And I'm trying to figure out still, like what does it mean to be a crypto native creator and build an audience in Web3, right? Do you have any insight on that? Like, do you have any opinions on that? Well, I think you're on the frontier. So what you're coming up with from an idea standpoint is the innovation that, you know, enough people doing it, you'll start to come up with the new patterns that may be more crypto native or Web3 native. And so one thing that you mentioned that I think is really interesting is you actually have insight into what your listeners, assuming you kind of correlate listeners on a Web3 social network like Forecaster or other ones, you can actually look at their on-chain activity and then start to glean insights and say, oh, interesting. 100 people who are following me also have the new Reddit avatar that's on Polygon, I think. And maybe I should actually reach out to Reddit and see if I can find the lead engineer or product manager who did that product as a way for you to offer a more compelling interview that is really relevant to your audience or at least a portion of your audience. And then that person might not have been interviewed before in terms of like a bigger podcast show that tends to focus on the CEO or something like that. And so I think that those insights that you can start to permissionlessly get from your audience may offer better tailored content for your audience or like subset segments of your audience. I also think that the concept of fandom is, I'm not nearly as deep as some of the other people in the space who are building dedicated companies to this, but I just think it's a really interesting concept. Because if you take Crypto on Web3 and put it this up, for as long as music has existed, there's always been that kind of early fan hipster who finds a band, really enjoys them when they're kind of under the radar and really passionate about it. That early passion creates some word of mouth, which creates more, and then that network effect, right? You can kind of model a band like a social network, gets big enough that the band becomes more mainstream, which then brings in even more people. But the original people who were early kind of get disaffected. It's like, oh, I liked them before they got big or they sold out or whatever. And just the idea that there could be a provable way, not even have a financial setup, just a provable way to say, oh, I used to listen to X artists before they were cool, right, the classic hipster line. And it's like, okay, well, prove it. Like show me the music NFT, or you get to a level where every Spotify stream somehow is in a decentralized data structure. We're ways away from that if that ever happens. But you can generally understand the concept that provable, skin in the game, historical on kind of an immutable ledger, it starts to open up some new interesting experiences, right? Maybe those artists now can actually say, hey, yeah, we're really big. We do these big stadium tours, but every year we do a concert in New York City at Madison Square Garden for our original 50,000 fans. And for the rest of your life, you have access to that concert. That kind of seems interesting. You can find someone like a Web2 person who hates Web3 is gonna go, oh, wait, well, you could have had a fan club and then you can do, fine, yeah, you could do that. But I think like part of the beauty of Web3 is it changes people kind of to think bigger or new paradigms. And the ability to permissionlessly do that is pretty cool, right? Imagine if you give a free concert to your original 10,000 fans, don't even need to pay, just show up to the door, show me the NFT, that's it. Like no money exchange has this pure brand. Can't do that in Web2 for the most part, right? Like you'd have to maintain this list and well, okay, what happens when you wanna switch providers? Whereas if it just lives on the blockchain, it doesn't matter, like that NFT will exist. And so- Let alone try to get that information too. Like when a creator builds an audience on like a Web2 native platform, there's only so much information that they can get access to, right? Whereas in crypto, when you're building these audiences using either tokens or NFT, whatever it may be, right? Like that lives immutably. Like you can always go back to that record. Like one thing that I'm thinking, like at some point, as the podcast grows, I can do some type of like David Letterman type of shit, where I just like rent an auditorium and everybody that's sort of collected my early seasonal NFTs, they'll have access to watch like a live interview with us, right? And experience that. Yeah. I think that's really cool. I'm also trying to think from like a monetization point of view. I think we sort of maybe just skim the surface of what monetization looks like. A lot of my bet is that all media will be tokenized to an extent, right? And all media, everything will be collectible to an extent, in some shape or form. And what does that look like in terms of monetization? So right now, a lot of creators, they measure success from like views on YouTube or subscribes, right? How does that look like in the context of Web3? Does that mean the number of unique holders that you have at scale, right? Does that mean like the number of primary and secondary sales you have? Like what gets, how do you measure the success of a creator? I don't know. I'm thinking out loud over here. But yeah. Well, again, I go back to this idea that I think Web2 is very much about quantity. Everything is about scale, like total number of users. Cristiano Ronaldo has, you know, a hundred million followers on Instagram or Kim Kardashian. And that's how you talk about it. I think biology has come up kind of with this concept of like being able to measure a fan economy is a far more interesting thing. So fine, Kim might have a hundred million followers on Instagram, but what is the GDP of the Kim Kardashian expanded universe, right? Like as a gimmick, but people laugh at that, right? So he was saying this a couple of years ago and now Kim Kardashian's potentially starting a private equity firm based on the fact that she's gonna potentially be able to use that distribution. And so I think that what gets interesting is if you can actually take the distribution out of the silos, like I have this many followers on YouTube, I have this many followers on Twitter and you move it to kind of these decentralized, credibly neutral kind of core data structures where now the relationship is between the creator, the publisher, whatever, and the people who choose to follow them, right? And that is a, actually it's an opt-in relationship, right? Because the person can always unfollow you. It's not like you own that follower forever, right? But the key is that no one can come in and say, oh, you know what, in terms of service violation, we've decided that what you said here is no longer acceptable. You've spent 10 years building an audience, tough luck, boom, right? You get kicked off YouTube or Twitter, there's no recourse, there's no exit, there's no, oh, take your followers, here you go, here are all their emails, now you can email them. And so I think if you look at just the way web to social media is, you as a creator have to spend way more time of, you either take the bet on these platforms will keep you forever, probably fine, or you do the extra effort of, hey, subscribe, also sign up for my newsletter so I don't have a direct line of communication with you. Whereas fast forward, if these web three social protocols work, you as a creator, you just have a direct relationship. You wanna send them a podcast, you wanna send them a video, you wanna send them a cast, can basically come through a variety of different clients, applications, channels, but that relationship is a single relationship and it belongs to the two of you.
