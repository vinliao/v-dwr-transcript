# 155 - The Rise of Decentralized Social Networks with Farcaster’s Dan Romero [nGDIdbdtdjE]_part1

I've been in crypto for 10 years. I think Ethereum is the right balance between decentralization and pragmatism. And I think building things that people can use are an underrated thing in crypto. I think a lot of people tend to focus on the ideology, which is important. But what I showed up to work at Coinbase and now what I'm doing with Forkaster is I want to build a protocol that has a billion plus people using it, but I want to do it in a way that doesn't compromise on the decentralization and the sovereignty at the user account level. Maybe it's a fool's errand, but that's what we're trying to do. Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more bankless. Do we really need decentralized social media? Our guest today, Dan Romero, says yes, and he explains why. We talk about the rise of decentralized social networks. A few takeaways for you in today's episode. Number one, why Dan thinks social media isn't broken, uses a different term. And we discuss what he means by that and why. And number two, we talk about what's new with decentralized social media. Why should people actually care about this? Not the hardcore crypto people who love decentralization, but the normal people, the masses. Number three, we talk about how decentralized a social media network actually has to be in order to work. What should be on chain and what doesn't need to be on chain. Number four, we talk about why a protocol, not a company, is really the way forward. And finally, we conclude the conversation about how all of this will fundamentally change the internet and the trajectory of humanity. David, what should listeners pay attention to this episode? Dan Romero is of course building Farcaster, but I think he also really just lays out the blueprint for any decentralized social media network, any protocol. And so while this is under the context of Farcaster, I think whatever decentralized social network does emerge out of the Web3 space, it's largely going to be synonymous with the blueprint, the map that Dan has laid out in this episode. And so I think this episode, I think it's actually going to be relatively timeless. Even if Farcaster for some reason doesn't see success, some other social media decentralized protocol will eventually, and it will largely follow the same blueprint that Dan lays out in this episode. So I think that's really the thing to pay attention to is, as you are listening to this, understand what primitives will be true no matter what flavor of social media protocol comes out of this space. Because I think if you're bullish on this space, you are certainly bullish that eventually one will come out. Maybe it's Farcaster, maybe it's a few others, maybe it's others we haven't heard about, but they're largely going to follow some of the same primitives and same first principles that were communicated on this episode. In the debrief, David and I are going to discuss what we think about our experience with current decentralized social networks as well. So stay tuned if you're a premium member, you can click right into that debrief.

So here's what you should do. Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet, and Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get. And it also does PoApps and mintable NFTs. Any kind of money that your wallet can claim, Earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now, because some airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new airdrop for it to make sure that you never lose an airdrop ever again. You can also upgrade to Earnify Premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets. And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one airdrop. So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get. That's E-A-R-N-I dot F-I. And make sure you never lose another airdrop. Hey, Bankless Nation. If you're listening to this, it's because you're on the free Bankless RSS feed.

Bankless Nation talking about decentralized social networks today with Dan Romero. Here's the co-founder of Farcaster, which is a new decentralized social network that's captured the attention of many in Web3. There are a few platforms competing for our attention these days, and Farcaster is certainly one of them. We're going to talk all about that today. And Dan, it's great to have you. Welcome to Bankless. Thanks for having me. Okay, let's start here with the big question. What is broken about Web2? Why do we need Web3 social networks? Why can't we just be satisfied with the Web2 versions of these things? And how do we even improve on those versions in a crypto version of a social network? Well, maybe I'll start with the contrarian answer is I don't necessarily think Web2 is broken. I think it can be improved upon. And so if you kind of just take the history of the Internet, Web1, you have decentralized protocols, HTTP, SMTP, DNS. And if you wanted to put information online, you basically went, registered a domain, figured out a web host, put up a website, and then hope people would find you. Google made it a little bit easier. And then you kind of had with Web2 this explosion of user-generated content. And with that user-generated content, you got to a place where distribution became a lot easier, right? You could start a podcast, put it on the iTunes store, and then eventually on YouTube, use Twitter for that distribution, have a sub stack. And so you kind of have all these great publishing tools where you can reach a massive audience. And right, like the whole creator economy as a result of Web2 getting these platforms to scale and then allowing people who might be a little less tech savvy, but really want to go be entrepreneurial and build an audience like yourselves to get to a really large scale. But as that scale happened, we went from kind of this, the classic nag on Twitter in the early days was, it's just a bunch of people saying what they ate for breakfast and then kind of call it around, I don't know, 2017, 2018, it was a threat to democracy. And so it's kind of a pretty big jump in a 10-year period to go from kind of a bunch of nerds talking about what they had for breakfast to, this is going to foundationally change the way our society is run. And I think with that kind of growing importance in society and just by function of having billions of people using all of these Web2 services every day, we're starting to see some of the limitations of kind of having a single platform be, for example, the public square on the internet, if you want to describe Twitter like that. It makes it really difficult when you have a global audience and a global user base to have a group of people in San Francisco, whether it's the public version of Twitter or a Twitter owned by Elon Musk, making decisions that impact how discourse, speech, communication happens globally. And I think where we sit now is, I think people from across the political spectrum, I think for the last few years, it was almost kind of like hardcore crypto people were interested in decentralization, and then there was this kind of branding that the only people interested in new social networks were kind of like right wing people who had been de-platformed from a Twitter. But I think quickly we've seen with Elon taking over, there's a whole new group of people who are all of a sudden being like, hey, I should be able to post a link to a Mastodon post and not have it be censored. And so I think people are reevaluating some of this stuff from first principles and realizing, hey, there are other protocols out there on the internet today that we use that are decentralized, permissionless, the web and email being two really important ones. I mean, Substax is a great example of a Web2 company built on top of a decentralized protocol, email. And so I think what we're hoping to do with Forecaster is marry the kind of decentralized and permissionless protocols of Web1 with the usability, convenience, ease of use that Web2 has ushered in that billions of people around the world are now able to create user generated content online and kind of participate. And so I think if you can marry the two of those things together, then you have a superior system. So I think what you're saying is the distinction that you're making when I use the term broken to maybe characterize Web2, you're sort of toning that down. You're saying, well, not broken in that we need to do a wholesale rip and replace, but there are fundamental areas of improvement. So not broken, but improvement. And I think maybe this is kind of semantics between the idea of something broken, the idea of something needing to be improved. But I think what you're saying is don't throw out the baby with the bath water here. There are some fundamental things that Web2 did correctly, namely getting the use case right. And what we actually need to do is figure out a way to improve on all of the flaws. If we were to look at some of the flaws with Web2 right now, I think you sort of hinted at a few of them. But this notion of Web2 going to a place where Twitter going to a place where it was basically doing nothing to it was destabilizing our democracy. Wow, that happened very quickly. And so that's one thing that people point to. Another thing is bots are everywhere. There's no concept of no notion of good identity or human based identity. Another of course, as you kind of alluded to this, is it's very controlled. That means it's very censorable. I don't have the ability to kind of own my own Twitter profile and my social graph. It's basically the property of Twitter. And I feel somewhat like a peasant on someone else's feudal land. So maybe these are the things. Is that list what you would point to as the improvement areas? And I guess my question is, how does Web3 help any of that? And does it actually help any of that? Yeah, so I think all of those points that you made are accurate and things that Web3 can improve on. But the way I describe Farcaster is there are two foundational principles that we are trying to achieve, and they solve two different problems. So the first is more for someone who has an audience, right? You have an audience with this podcast. You rely on Web2 platforms, which give you, again, massive distribution, ability to get your word out. But you don't own your audience on, I'd say, most of those platforms. Substack being a rare example where if you're using a platform like YouTube, you could have built up 10 million followers over five years. And on an arbitrary whim, no matter what the reason, they can turn your account off and you have no ability to get kind of like one last export of those subscribers. They have, by the way, Dan. I don't know if you're aware of this, but on Mother's Day of last year, YouTube shut down bankless. I thought you were going to say that they let you export the subscribers. Wow, that's a pretty pioneering thing. Nope. They shut us down. The worst one. Yeah. And so what do we do? We go into no word, no word of warning, just an email, a friendly email from some bot somewhere that says, your account shut down. And there was no kind of escalation process. And the only thing we could do, Dan, at that time was to get real loud on other social media platforms and say, look what Twitter, look what YouTube did to us. Which was only a luxury that we really had because other accounts were shut down that same day that didn't have the same sort of like feed following that we were able to invigorate to get the attention of YouTube. Yeah. So I apologize for interrupting you, but this happens. It happens in crypto. It happens in other communities as well. So go on. Well, yeah, I guess I don't need to sell you on this, but the idea that you could have built up this audience, generate a lot of revenue for whatever platform, and with the snap of a finger, it's gone. There is no arbitration. There is no get in front of a judge and make your case. Instead you get an automated support email treating you no different than one of the kind of like CZ spam bots on Twitter. I think that is unacceptable in a world where creators are real businesses and this is your livelihood. And so contrast that to email where if for whatever reason you decided to not work with Substack or Substack didn't want to work with you, it would be ludicrous if they held your emails hostage. Right? And part of that is just a norms thing, right? Email pre-existed a lot of these Web2 platforms. The idea that if you have an email newsletter, you own your newsletter subscriber list is just kind of that's what the market forces. Whereas I think with these Web2 platforms, because they've been so attractive from providing distribution and scale, they've been able to get away with not allowing a kind of publisher or a creator to own their audience directly. And so I think the foundational to Farcaster is you own your relationship with your audience. And actually it's not even quite that because it's your audience owns the relationship with you, right? So if someone follows you on Farcaster, it's not like somehow you now can kind of go ping them. They've actually opted into following you. But the important thing is no third party can come in and say, sorry, these two adults cannot decide to connect with each other over the internet. So that's on the creator publisher side. I think that the second thing that's really important, and maybe I'm dating myself here, but I remember when Twitter was a very open API and had a flourishing ecosystem of apps. And a lot of people don't even know a lot of the core features of Twitter were invented A, by Twitter users and B, first adopted in third party clients. So app replies, hashtags, quote tweets, retweets, those were all conventions within the 140 character tweet box. And then you had clients like Tweetbot, Twitterific, Tweety inventing, okay, this is how you natively handle it. And for the first few years, Twitter didn't even have a mobile client. They actually acquired the app called Tweety, which invented pull to refresh. So all of the apps that use pull to refresh today, you actually use a patent that Twitter owns and has decided to not generously not prosecute against. And anytime you use pull to refresh in an app that was invented by a third party developer on Twitter's API. And then roughly around 2014, they basically shut that down. They needed to make money on advertising. And it's very difficult to do that in a kind of third party app ecosystem. And actually more timely, as of I think like last week, they just turned off third party apps, right? They've kind of existed in this like weakened state for the last 10 years. But now like I don't think Tweetbot works, like they just shut it off overnight. And again, no communication. These are people building businesses, even in this kind of like weird world where Twitter never really liked their API. And another prominent example from the previous era was Facebook had an open platform. Pre-mobile, it was kind of like all these games and all these things that are built on top of it. Django was a company that basically built this entire business on Facebook. And then in a very short period of time, they kind of said, hey, this is deprioritized, tough luck, like, go find a new way to build out these games. And so those two examples from that era changed, I think, a lot of developers' opinions on I'm not going to go build a business or make a serious investment in a platform, knowing that you can have the rug pulled out from under them. And so I think with Farcaster, very much inspired by Ethereum and my time in crypto, it's you need to build a platform that hits a bar that is truly permissionless, both on the access to the data and the APIs to the system working so that as a developer, if you want to go build a client, I, as one of the early people building the actual protocol, shouldn't have a say what client can be built, just like Ethereum, right? I want to go build a competitor to Metamask. There's not some approval process that said, well, Metamask was the first wallet or one of the first wallets, so we're going to actually decide whether wallets can come in. A rainbow Coinbase wallet, you know, anyone can go build a wallet on top of a network like Ethereum. And I think that makes Ethereum stronger for it. So that's the other bar we want to hit with Farcaster. So you own your own audience or that relationship belongs to you. And as a developer, your relationship with your users and the data, completely permissionless. I think that was a really great exploration into some of the shortcomings of the current Web2 world. And Dan, I know that you said there's not much broken about Web2. There's only things that we can learn and build upon. But I think in your answer just now, a answer to the question of what's broken about Web2 is actually kind of like the shareholder equity incentive structure, because that's what created a bunch of monopolistic tendencies that you just listed out from Twitter and Facebook, where Twitter began as a very open ecosystem with APIs to enable third party creators. And due to what Twitter is, a Web2 company, any sort of thing of value that got built by somebody else was simply absorbed into Twitter. And eventually that aggregation and centralization and monopolization created the Twitter, the closed form of Twitter that we see today. And same thing with Zynga and Facebook. So maybe to answer what's broken about Web2 is actually like the traditional equity structure that a lot of these normal companies are kind of built into. And so I want to ask a question like, we can ask the question, what's broken about Web2 and what does Web3 do to fix this? I want to ask this in a slightly different way. There's a very early implementation of Ethereum was Peepeth, which was Twitter on Ethereum, where we could just say, oh, we can make Twitter, but Web3. We'll take Twitter, we'll copy and paste it and we'll put it on Ethereum. And then boom, we have decentralized Twitter. That really never took off. But maybe under a farcaster kind of structure that might be able to work. But there's one aspect of this conversation, which is how can we just take.

# 155 - The Rise of Decentralized Social Networks with Farcaster’s Dan Romero [nGDIdbdtdjE]_part2

systems that already exist, Twitter, Facebook, and then make them decentralized in a more open environment. But also, what does Web3 native social networks enable that Web2 social networks will never really be able to enable? So there's like some conversations which are like, we can, a decentralized Web3 version of Twitter can help with making sure that people don't get deplatformed but that's only about fixing Web2's faults. What about these more decentralized social networks? What can they really enable that Web2 will never really be able to enable? What's the unique properties, what unique properties about Web3 social will Web2 never really be able to have? I wanna start with first, going back to this idea of developers having permissionless access to the data and APIs. I think that in of itself is underrated in that if you allow developers complete freedom to do whatever they want, they're unbounded in terms of, if they have a creative idea, they can go do it. And then they have to convince other people to use it as a separate thing, but there are no API terms of service that they necessarily need to worry about. And I think that alone is actually an important thing. And whether you call that, oh, you could build that in Web2 or Web3, but put it to the side is like that just existing is a primary motivation for building something like Forecaster. As it relates to more specific features around cryptocurrencies, we can talk a couple. We have one today. So we actually allow you to connect another wallet within Forecaster. And so you can kind of have a native newsfeed of what the people you're following, you're following them for the Twitter-like content, like small text posts, but also what's happening on chain. And so you're kind of getting this blended newsfeed of the kind of stuff that they're talking about, but then also what people are actually doing on the blockchain, which it natively starts to create conversational points around anything that you are doing on chain. You met an NFT, now that natively shows up in the feed, which now NFTs, instead of being this kind of single player thing can now be more multiplayer. Composability of feeds. Exactly. So that, and then I think that the other thing, Forecaster's namespace account, right? Like the way you kind of define yourself is also an NFT. And so that's gonna be an Ethereum L1 next year. And so then you get all the composability that can happen with an NFT. So you could have an account that's owned by a group of people right, and you could have a New York City 20 token associated with that. And I don't know, use a nouns DAO, style governance. Like it's just like the possibilities are endless in terms of ownership of a given account. So there's gonna be a lot of composable stuff that will happen there. And then I think the other important thing is every user on Forecaster by definition has a working public and private key, happens to be an Ethereum address. And if you think about what that all of a sudden starts to enable, you can out of the box have end to end encrypted direct messaging that is as good as, and in some ways better because you don't need to have a phone number associated with it. Another example that you can start to kind of think about because there's a lot of development that's happening in zero knowledge proofs is you kind of have all these academic potential uses of zero knowledge proofs that now can be developed permissionlessly by any developer because you can make the strong assumption that every user already has a live working public and private key. And so you could potentially make new types of speech that is kind of like based on some amount of on-chain credential, but at the same time you don't necessarily have to reveal who you are. So a basic example would be, I own a CryptoPunk. I wanna actually be able to say something anonymously, but have the credibility to say, I own a CryptoPunk. If that's something that matters to you. But you could imagine other types of on-chain credentials that could be, I don't know, around politics or around medicine. And now I could be a doctor who is well-regarded, right? Maybe I've won some prestigious medal in the field and I wanna speak up about something in medicine, but I feel like if I was to do that under my real name, I would get a lot of pushback from the community versus I could say something, have the credential that is provable on-chain and actually do that in a zero knowledge way. So I think those primitives are going to allow developers to have just kind of a lot of creativity in what they build. And so we're really focused on building the core level set of primitives and then really trying to make it a developer platform that you build Uniswap, you get, or sorry, you build Ethereum, then you eventually get Uniswap or OpenSea and you start to get people's creativity is actually what drives the growth and the use cases. Okay, Dan, we're definitely peering at the top of this very large rabbit hole, which is this whole entire conversation of more decentralized social networks. And we've touched on a bunch of different possible like paths that we can go down. I wanna go back to one that we've already started to go down and I really want to drive this point home because I think it is at the basement of what is a very large stack of cool, awesome expressivity of developers and users on top of it. And it goes back to what you said about assurances around like the open API structure or like the assurances that developers can develop on this platform and not get rugged. Cause that's a big talking point about like, even like Facebook's like changing or closing down their APIs. This conversation goes back to like, why does Ethereum exist? To build unstoppable applications. And this also is a very core property, a very core theme of what we often frequently talk about at Bankless, which is settlement assurances. We use the term settlement assurances to describe property rights. Like why is Ethereum and Bitcoin different than like Litecoin or insert your faster, smaller blockchain here? It's because of settlement assurances. You are assured that your property is yours because of how strong the security is on Ethereum and smart contracts, right? And so these settlement assurances allow people to think into the future. And we've related this conversation to like things like laws with the Supreme Court. An executive order is a very fast law out of the president. It can get overturned by Congress. But if Congress writes a law, that can get overturned by the Supreme Court. And when the Supreme Court says it's final, it is final. And what we've created with smart contracts is a new level of finality that gives people settlement assurances to think into the longterm. And that's the same conversation I'm seeing what you're talking about with creating a developer platform that developers can't get rugged. And I want to ask you about what is the difference in the assurances that developers have in this new world? And what are the downstream net effects of producing a developer platform where the developers have the assurances that the structures that they build will be around forever? What kind of creativity is unlocked at that point? Yeah, so I want to be clear upfront. One of the reasons Farcaster is still invite only is we aren't at that bar internally of what we'd say is like an unruggable platform. And we've put a lot of effort in over the last year and we're hopefully getting pretty close. We're hoping to have it kind of midway through this year at a place where Farcaster from a developer standpoint is actually permissionless and call it unruggable or the idea is you're sovereign. As a developer, you will have full access to the data and APIs of the protocol. And that's built with something called Farcaster hubs. And actually I think it's important to delineate that we only do a minimal amount of stuff on chain. And part of that is actually we're trying to keep cost, fees and usability high and cost and fees down. And so what we do is when you sign up for an account, we actually create that on chain. Today it's on test net, it will be on Ethereum L1, hopefully by July. And what's great is as a default, every single user on Farcaster owns their actual account, their identity. And to use another example, a system like email. So if you use a Gmail address, you actually don't own that Gmail address. Gmail can actually at any time just revoke that Gmail address. There is no arbitration, you can't port it to another service. Now, if you're a little bit more sophisticated and you own your own domain, you can use G Suite, pay a little bit more, and then now you have the ability to port your email. So email is a, technically it does work in that you can port, but the practical reality is most people use a free email address. And actually they don't have to think about it most of the time, but if you do run into an edge case where you do get suspended by Google and you lose access to your email, that's a really, really tough thing. With Farcaster, we're making the decision that every single user, no matter how sophisticated they are, actually gets a sovereign identity that's going to be on Ethereum. And we actually use something called like a gasless transaction, a meta transaction, and we just seamlessly onboard people through the Farcaster client. And we actually think that that's great because it allows both a sophisticated person and a non-sophisticated person to just onboard just like they would web2, but behind the scenes, they do have the actual ability to move that identity anywhere they want and within any client they want. And so that's actually a foundational component to what the user is on Farcaster, but more importantly, that also gives the developer the assurance that if they convince a user to use their app, there is no third party that can come in and say, like this Twitter example, oh, sorry, we're the one that actually owns the identity, we're gonna revoke that. Contrast that to actually a federated system, something like Macedon, you're getting your identity provided to you by a server. So if that server wants to revoke your identity, unless you're running your own server, like it's gonna be very similar from an email standpoint in that you just lose access to that identity. So having the pointer be sovereign and actually on Ethereum L1, we think is worth the cost and the complexity to do that. In addition to the composability and I think the general benefit that you can get from having it sovereignly owned on Ethereum. Getting the other data in APIs to a permissionless state, once these kind of hubs exist, which you can think of a hub as like the Ethereum node, but for the Forecaster network. The other decision we've made is, we are actually going to limit the amount of data per user on the protocol in an effort to keep the requirements of running one of these hubs reasonable for an average developer. And so you can think of it like this, we're gonna cap you at the equivalent of 10,000 tweets, we call them casts. So on the 10,000 first cast, we bump your oldest one out at the protocol level. And then that's the implementation for the hub. And so some people might be like, oh, well, I wish we could have all of it, but the nice thing one, all the data is permissionless. So you could back it up to our Weaver IPFS. You can do that yourself. But the benefit that you do get in kind of making this bounded data per user is we really think we can get up to 100 independent hubs that are running, which are all going to have a full global state of the network. In the same way that if you're running a full Ethereum node, you're gonna have full global state. And that ability for a developer forces the network from a kind of like, we can't be a bad actor as the kind of initial developers and having the biggest client. We can't say, oh, we're gonna gate this stuff because we've actually intentionally built the protocol in a way that I can be, you know, two years from now as an independent developer, I can spin up a hub and I can actually have the full global state of what the forecaster protocol is in a given point. And we think it's worth- There's a bunch of parallels with this design with how the Ethereum protocol is designed, which makes me think that you're onto something here. I've been in crypto for 10 years. I think Ethereum is the right balance between decentralization and pragmatism. And I think building things that people can use are an underrated thing in crypto. I think a lot of people tend to focus on the ideology, which is important. But what I showed up to work at Coinbase and now what I'm doing with forecasters, I wanna build a protocol that has a billion plus people using it, but I wanna do it in a way that doesn't compromise on the decentralization and the sovereignty at the user account level. Maybe it's a fool's errand, but that's what we're trying to do. That's super cool. This idea of building a social platform that is rugless. Not bankless, but rugless, which maybe that's another podcast we spin up at some point in time, David. But I think devs will appreciate that, particularly devs who kind of look at sort of the long-term. I think that the bet here you're making is that, I mean, when Twitter destroyed its APIs, it essentially destroyed all of its permissionless innovation, didn't it? And the only innovation that could happen is innovation that could happen with its internal employees. By the way, they just reduced their headcount by 50%. So do we think we're going to get any new big features from Twitter anytime soon? We'll see. Probably not. But this, it creates kind of a permissionless ecosystem. And I think that's the bet, that permissionless ecosystems win out because you have everybody in the world sort of hacking on this. And the best employees and the best developers don't actually work for your company, do they? They're outside in places in India or all parts around the world. So I get that. I think from somebody who's not a developer, somebody who's never been deplatformed before, they're still not quite clear on this value proposition entirely. And I want to get back to David's question of, what's new about Web3? Like, why is it a step improvement from a Web2 social media tool if I haven't been deplatformed yet? And I think that's, the majority of people listening to this have not been deplatformed from Twitter or from Facebook or from their YouTube account. They can imagine it might happen, but things would have to get bad, dystopian, in order to do that. And so they don't really see the value proposition of being rugless. That's why I want to go back to kind of the on-chain features that you're adding. So, Dan, before we entered this episode and started recording, David and I had an opportunity to go download Farcaster on our iOS device, an app type version. And for listeners right now, I believe, Dan, this is all kind of private beta, so it's invite only. And so we asked you, we're like, hey, Dan, you're coming on, can we get the invite link? And you sent us that, thank you. What's interesting about this is, I kind of see things that social media apps are not providing today, right? Like the Twitters of the world and the Instagrams. You have this whole section of events that you were talking about, where I just plugged one of my ETH addresses in, and I can see that I'm into the Bankless Ultrasound Money podcast episode. It's right in my events queue. And I could go look at David's profile and I could see all of the things that he did with his on-chain data in his wallet. And that's kind of interesting to me, right? Maybe I set an alert, for every time David buys an NFT, so I can ape in. Because he's got the alpha. And then there's this tab called NFTs, where I can see kind of the NFTs added to my address. And then you're making this comment about identity. Well, I was actually able to set up an RSA, at RSA is my handle on Farcaster right now. And you're saying that in the future will be kind of, it's smart contract driven, and it's fully composable with the rest of the on-chain default data. And I think that's going to be a big part of the on-chain DeFi, NFT, Web3 ecosystem as well. And so we have these kind of primitives. And I guess what I'm saying is, I think this is a thesis now that we get into it. We're still very early, but I think that every single social media app is going to need to be redesigned to incorporate on-chain Web3 data sets, tokens, NFTs, identity, and I think, Dan, they're going to be super freaking slow to do this and respond. And they're going to be leapfrogged by social media applications and platforms that actually do. And maybe even, they'll find that it's counterproductive to their business model to expand into Web3. I'm reminded of like Instagram right now. They just rolled out an NFT feature. Guess what? There's a 15 to 30% tax if you issue an NFT on their platform that they take. That's a pretty high take rate for Web3. Like we don't do that in crypto, do we? That's kind of again- We don't do that here. Yeah, we don't do that here. And so I guess what I'm saying is, this is early stages, but I sort of see when I download something like Farcaster, I get like the Twitter experience, but now I have some on-chain data that's added to this, and it's starting to become valuable. Because the big question for me going into a conversation like this, Dan, is like, I know people aren't just going to come for the censorship resistance. It's decentralized. Okay, cool. I don't care. I'm not being deplatformed. They will come for the features. And to the extent that you are able to innovate faster on those Web3 features and make that valuable, then I think we'll start to kind of draw the audience. Anyway, that's how I'm thinking about it. What's your take on that thesis? We completely agree. And it's actually one of the reasons we're doing both the protocol and the initial client at the same time. Because our view was, one, we could go build the world's best protocol, but then we're going to have to spend a whole bunch of time trying to convince other people to build on top of it. And that in of itself is extremely hard. And so where we started was, hey, we're going to build the protocol and the initial client, and we're going to do a whole bunch of hard work to try to figure out features and a set of use cases that are going to get at least some initial group of daily active users. Because I don't think any other developer is going to want to go build on the protocol if it doesn't already have active users, because users use software, they use clients. And so that's why we started with building our initial client, built those initial features. And our thesis is, if you build the best network for people who are interested in crypto and web3, that is an amazing initial starting community, especially if you believe that we're going to continue to have more stuff that ends up on chain, whether that's visible or kind of like behind the scenes in the background, that's our bet. Building the initial app is a social network for people interested in crypto and web3, and thus the set of features that we've built, right? If you say GM on Farcaster, we change the like button to a GM, you have the NFT features. If you actually go to any given NFT, a CryptoPunk, you can actually see everyone else on Farcaster that provably owns that NFT, right? So if you find that there's some community, whether it's on a CryptoKovn, CryptoPunks, that you are interested in finding those other people, you can actually just go and follow every single person. So you could go take your bankless NFT, click that as a category, and then actually find everyone else on Farcaster who minted that NFT. And so those types of features are, for our initial user base, highly engaging, and we're going to continue to add more of those. And then actually we have a kind of bet that over the course of the next few years, you're going to have more and more just things, web3 objects is what we call them, just natively represented on chain, a mirror post is another great example. From the surface to the average user, that looks like a medium post, right? Like no different, it's a bunch of text rendered on a webpage. But what's cool about a mirror post is you can have the instantiation of it on our weave, right? We can permissionlessly pull that into our client. In addition, there's interactivity with a mirror post because you can mint it and you can trade it and collect it. And so all of that functionality, if we're kind of taking web3 as the bet and understanding natively what's happening on chain inside of a social experience, you almost start to get all this innovation that's happening on chain for free, right? So if you're natively servicing whatever someone's doing on chain in a social way, there's some new use case that pops up. You're now starting to kind of have an initial conversation about it, but then you can actually add and make the features even better. And so that's for sure how we're approaching it. And I don't know if you've heard of it,

# 155 - The Rise of Decentralized Social Networks with Farcaster’s Dan Romero [nGDIdbdtdjE]_part3

a lot of criticism that I've heard about Farcaster's futile to be working on this stuff because it's too crypto centric. Our point of view is we'd rather actually focus on what might seem like a niche, but a niche that is the future. And for us, if you can actually get the smartest people in crypto engaging in high quality way on this new social network, I think it'll naturally start to bring other people who are curious and because they're going to say, oh, this is high quality discourse, right? Vitalik is talking about the need for new institutions on Farcaster and he gets 40 replies that are actually thoughtful and not a lot of spam. That in of itself is also kind of interesting. And so I think for us, it's very much about we have to build a compelling product that people can use as a way of bootstrapping the actual protocol. Because if you can get to some semblance, whether it's 10,000 or 100,000 active users on the protocol, then I actually start to think that you're going to get critical mass for developers interested in building other new applications, which may actually increase the aperture, right? Someone goes, builds a very specific app that's dedicated to sports fans. We're never going to be the best at that. But if someone else has a great idea for that, and you already have a hundred thousand people who are actively using the protocol, that's your initial seed community. And then you bring in people who have no idea that this is all powered by crypto. They're just coming to use that app. So the initial use case here for Farcaster, the focus from a user persona, like the type of user that you want is like the full NFT crypto native type person. And they're going to want to migrate here because Twitter doesn't have the features, doesn't have the on-chain features that they actually want and need for their communities. Not the censorship resistance. Because I completely agree with you. The reveal preference is most people don't care, right? Like they only care when they eventually get booted, but for most people that doesn't happen. So Twitter actually works for them right now. So you have to have better features. You don't care Dan that right now the criticism people say, yeah, but the crypto native population is so small. I mean, what are we talking about? Maybe millions of people. How many daily active users does Metamask have? That's kind of your target market, basically. Your response to that is, I don't care. Cause that number's going up and it's going up real fast. Basically, I think that and people who are building the future are inevitably, that's where people are going to want to spend time. And I think if you were to look at early Twitter in 2007, 2008, it was a bunch of tech nerds in San Francisco who were going to South by Southwest. And that was the criticism. It's like, okay, this is just a bunch of nerds who would want to like share what they're having for breakfast. These people are narcissists. And maybe there's some truth to people who use Twitter. I use Twitter a lot that they're narcissists, but the reality is, is it turns out there are a lot of people in the world who find that interesting, even if they're not into tech, it just took 10 years to get there. We're about 10 years out from threatening democracies is what you're saying with hype. I have a threat of democracy, but yes, I think things that are that kind of impact, massive impact, things that are big, look small and are very easy to ridicule. And I mean, I saw this at Coinbase, like I, my, I was there in 2014, 2015, 2016. And so many people are like, why are you wasting your time on Bitcoin? Like, like did Bitcoin die? Like all that stuff. Right. And actually Ethereum was what really kickstarted, I think the second chapter for Coinbase. And then after the kind of like 2017 hype cycle, it was clear that like crypto wasn't going to go away, at least to smart people. And I think you've had multiple cycles. But I think generally, I think that that's the same thing is going to happen for, for decentralized social networks is people are going to say that, oh, they're a toy. They're never going to hit scale. Like, you know, it's impossible to beat Facebook and all this kind of stuff. But look, I mean, if people say that you can't like compete with Facebook, one TikTok went from zero to whatever it is today in a very short period of time. And, and Facebook really hasn't been able to compete with that. So, A, that's a, that's a counter example that you can compete. And then two, we're seeing this even now, like people said last year, Google is, you can't compete with Google. And then all of a sudden, chat GPT shows up. And then people were like, oh my goodness, like this is going to replace Google. And I think that's probably overblown. But, but if you're working in technology and you're working in an area where there's just constant innovation and things are getting pushed forward to have the point of view that, that we're just going to be in this stasis where it's like impossible to beat the big guys. People used to say that about Microsoft and IBM. And, and so it's like, it's just like a lack of history for, for most of these folks. And so I'm, I'm completely fine being ignored for a while. All I want to do is make incremental progress every week, grow, grow the user base 5% every week, find people who are interested in the features that we're building, right. These crypto native features that aren't being built on other social networks. And this is the home for them. And over time, I think that the market gets big enough. And fortunately, I think we have a long-term perspective on that. It worked for Coinbase and hopefully it works for Farcaster. This Ryan reminds me of Chris Dixon's take that he had when we were talking to him way back when about how A16Z used to be called an internet fund. And then it just became a fund because the internet took over. And he's, his take was that that's going to be the same thing for crypto. It's like first A16Z's got like a crypto fund, but that's just going to take over what venture capital is because everything's going to become on crypto. And I think that's the same take that Dan's leading with is like, there's a population of highly engaged crypto people that crypto populations up only. And in the future, fast forward, five, 10 years, the crypto people are just the internet goers that we know of today. Dan, there's a, there's a, I want to drill down into this client centric design of a decentralized social network. Cause my take coming into this podcast is that there's actually no way to produce a decentralized social network without it being a client centric ecosystem. And also something you said earlier is about like, we can, we can create like a specific thing for sports fans that's built on Farcaster and it's just optimized for them. They don't even know that it's crypto. Uh, and this also goes back to what we were talking about earlier with like the open model for Twitter or Facebook, where there was like an app ecosystem and anyone can build on top of Twitter. The, the take, the belief I have is that that kind of open design allows for these systems to adapt and flex to the wants of their users. Like when many, many developers can build on top of something, they will build something that's fundamentally useful or, or, or it's not. And they stopped building it or it is, and they continue building it and they continue refining it. But first and foremost, it takes that, uh, open model, that open API model, that open design model to actually allow for developers to kind of believe that there's something useful there that they want to build and then go build it. And in stark contrast to the current web two model, the current web two world, where like, if you open up Twitter on the browser and then you open up Twitter on the phone, it's the same Twitter, same thing with Facebook. Like if you open up Facebook on the internet, facebook.com or the Facebook, the app, it's the same Facebook. But like, I'm, my intuition tells me that something with a decentralized social network, that's a very client heavy ecosystem is that it can change shape. It can change form based off of how you want it to be or who you are or the clients that you're using because you want to engage with it in a particular way. Can you elaborate on this like unique property of a decentralized social network? And I'm actually having trouble understanding what you mean by client centric. What does that even mean? Maybe the question for David and Dan too. Yeah. So the way I think about it is we want to build an internet scale protocol, internet scale protocol is going to have billions of people using it. And there are going to be many apps and services built on top of it. In order to get the many apps and services built on top of it to have those billions of people, you need developers interested in building. Developers are going to build on the thing that makes it easy for them to find users, right? The reason people build on mobile app stores, despite the 30% tax and all the ring of morale that they make you go through is when you have a phone, it's attached to your body when you're a daily active user of a phone. So it's this amazing platform to be able to build, get someone on, you know, to install your app, then you have push notifications. And so Apple has been able to bootstrap a huge ecosystem by virtue of actually just getting people to buy their phones and then hold them on their body all the time. So we wanted to take the same approach where the way to kickstart the Forecaster ecosystem is build the initial client, build some of these features that get people into the door. A lot of people didn't find them that interesting, but there were enough people that found them interesting that we were able to kind of create an initial kernel of users, highly engaged users, that once you hit a certain amount of conversational liquidity, so if you think of like DeFi, you need like TVL or whatever, that for social networks is, especially a public social network, if I open up the app, is there something new to see, right? And if it's too stale, then you're just going to have people turn. Whereas if you can kind of beg, borrow and steal, whatever you need to do to actually bootstrap that initial community, then what you can do is use the initial client to continue to onboard people, continue to grow the total number of addressable users on the protocol. But you're going to have developers start to tinker around because now there's all this data and there are all these users. And so we've seen, you know, a whole bunch of different apps built on top of the initial set of Forecaster APIs, which I think are really, really bad, but it just shows you that there's a lot of demand. People love playing around with this stuff because they didn't have to ask us for anything. They can just, once they, you know, want to build it, they can just go and do it. And it'll only get better later this year when we have hubs and we hit the bar around permissionlessness. But I think the, to go back to this kind of like why we think the client ecosystem is so important to get right, it goes back to your point of, or rather, if you think about what the hard thing is when building a social network, yes, it's coming up with some novel new mechanic and idea, but there are plenty of examples of people having built social networks with the mechanic maybe, you know, five years too early or whatever. And it's not on the merit of the idea. It's all about distribution and getting users. And so what we're trying to do is dramatically reduce the difficulty in having an app that has social features. People are already going to have an identity. They don't need to be onboarded again. They're going to potentially have all of this public data because it's a network like Twitter that you could potentially use machine learning to figure out what their preferences are. So I could, if I built that sports client, that's like if you're really into football and you had already talked about that you're a, I don't know, Vikings or a Giants fan in one of your casts before, I programmatically can kind of go look back. And then when you open up the app, it's like, it already auto-suggests what you're interested in. And so this access to the like foundational identity, the actual data, like what you're posting, what you're liking, who you're following, all of that information that is available, another developer can actually use to bootstrap their new app. And so making it easier, dramatically easier for new social apps to be built, because as a user, I don't need to re-sign up for like the whole system. And then similarly, like they can actually do a lot of intelligent stuff based on all the publicly available data, gets you to a place where it can be a shared layer of identity of the data. And then actually the other thing about it is you can now use it for distribution, right? And so we actually just had an app come out this weekend, still early stage called Absorb. And what they're doing is they're using the Forecaster protocol to post seven second videos in an, you know, oh divine. And the way it works in our client, it's going to show up where it says, I just posted a video to Absorb, click here. And we don't even have video in our client yet. We just haven't gotten around to putting that in there. But if you were to open up Absorb, it's actually going to show you all the other posts that are on the Forecaster protocol that follow that format in a very Vine or TikTok like way. And so it's using a subset of the protocol for all the kind of like primitives that is available to it. But then it can actually just build a completely new experience. And let's say that app starts to get bigger. Maybe there are plenty of people who use that app who don't even know that it's using Forecaster or crypto. It's just like, oh, cool. This is like some app where you have a bunch of people doing what they're doing. And maybe they come up with some new novel mechanic that's slightly different from Vine or TikTok that does really well with a certain sub segment of users. Great. That's all benefiting the Forecaster protocol and they're benefiting from the Forecaster protocol as well. So it's pretty symbiotic. I mean, I get all this and that's why I was kind of questioning, David, like why you call this a client centric design? Because to me, that's not, it's protocol centric really. What Dan is saying is we're doing the base protocol so that anyone can build a client on top of it. We're just bootstrapping the very first client in order to get people, that's like our bootloader for the client. But the value is really, is kind of the protocol. It's like as if Twitter released the Twitter website and the app in the early days. And then also a protocol that anyone could build on top of that was completely rugless. Or it's as if RSS, you know, RSS didn't pick up in many ways when RSS was first introduced. Well, maybe that was because RSS, there was never a kind of a company developing the first client for RSS and kind of like acting as a bootloader. So that's why I was asking David, why you called it a client centric design? Don't you mean like protocol centric design? Yes. Yeah. Protocol centric as in there's one Forecaster protocol. I guess what I meant by client centric is that whereas Twitter and Facebook are highly monopolistic and don't encourage a expressivity in having many, many, many clients, Forecaster does. And so it's putting clients as like, yo, we need clients. Clients need to be a first class citizen because there's many different ways to access the Forecaster protocol. And each client can pick and choose their own particular way of accessing the Forecaster protocol. And those different choices will be determined by the users of that particular client. But it's really like Forecaster winning like a thumb war in like protocol design. Whereas like in theory, there could be a Forecaster protocol and then there could be like the Facebook of Forecaster and the Twitter of Forecaster. Like these things can become apps. And the fact that Forecaster is a protocol is like you could have the Twitter app that is built on top of the Forecaster protocol. So yes, Ryan, you're right when it's there's like protocol centric, but the idea of a Cambrian explosion of specific clients that are built for specific purposes for specific audiences is what's missing from the Web2 world that makes it so like stagnant and stale and monopolistic. Dan, does all of this stuff check out? Yeah. And maybe to marry the two together, I would say it's the protocol is only good as good as the clients that are available for it, right? Because you could have technically brilliant protocol, but if there's no way for people to use it and use it like in a really highly usable way that they can install on their home screen, right? Because it is actually a battle for your thumbs. Are you going to hit Instagram or Twitter or you're going to hit Forecaster or some other app that's built on top of it? That's zero sum social like time is a zero sum thing and that's what you're competing for in social. And so in order to make the protocol useful, you need at least one client, right? And one client that's hopefully driven a whole bunch of users. Then I actually think the protocol, it's kind of a flywheel, right? So it's now you've actually bootstrapped it with some users. Now the protocol starts to be more attractive for other people to build clients. And then hopefully it kind of ping pongs back and forth there, whereas the more clients and more diversity of clients and different experiences you have, the more growth you're going to have for the protocol, the more growth for the protocol, the more people are interested in building clients. And so I think that is where we have been really, really focused. And what might differentiate us from others is we plan to work on our client, like this initial bootstrapping client for a very long time, if not forever, because I think for us, it forces us to dog food the protocol that we're expecting other people to build on. And so it's inevitably, we are going to know the pain points and the frustrations as a developer. It's like, wow, this is really hard. How could we, if we can't do it ourselves, or this is a pain in the ass for us to do, why would we expect anyone else to go through this? Like they're just probably going to go build somewhere else. And so by being kind of like putting ourselves as a developer on the protocol, it makes the protocol better because we're developing the protocol, but it also going back to what makes the protocol successful, it's getting users to use the protocol who become addressable users for other apps on the protocol. And so that's where I think the client and protocol aspects of the designer are critical, and they're very intertwined. Uniswap is the largest on-chain marketplace for self-custody digital assets. Uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new fiat on-RAM? Now you could go directly from fiat in your bank to tokens in DeFi inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism Layer 2s are supported right out of the gate, but that's just DeFi. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world. With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you. Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor. So go to app.uniswap.org today to buy, sell, or swap tokens and NFTs. Arbitrum 1 is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web3 landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum 1, producing flourishing DeFi and NFT ecosystems. With the recent addition of Arbitrum Nova, gaming and social dApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum 1 and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar, and fully EVM-compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With Arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now 10 times faster than before. Visit arbitrum.io where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first dApp. With Arbitrum, experience Web3 development the way it was meant to be. Secure, fast, cheap, and friction-free. I think Web2 users, which I know is everyone, can really resonate with this fixed state of the Web2 world. Why hasn't there been a new Web2 app that's come out in the last decade? We almost had, what was that? The audio clubhouse. We almost had clubhouse. Clubhouse took us by storm in the middle of COVID. We almost had a new one, but then what happened? Twitter just absorbed that feature into their monopoly of Twitter and took away that. Dan, you've been calling this cool new mechanism that it justifies a new social media app. But then all of these Web2 companies just absorbed those features into their larger centralized stack. I think one of the things that you alluded to is that as the farcaster protocol grows in users and utility, when somebody thinks up of a new mechanism like clubhouse did, that can be appended to the farcaster protocol via a client, but not actually have to compete with the other clients on farcaster because everyone is contributing to the growth of this protocol. It's a little bit like how I view the Ethereum layer 2 ecosystem. When Optimism wins and grows users in TVL, their net overflow of that also benefits all the other layer 2s on Ethereum. That's net beneficial to Arbitrum because when Optimism finds a new user, they're just one hop away from Arbitrum.

# 155 - The Rise of Decentralized Social Networks with Farcaster’s Dan Romero [nGDIdbdtdjE]_part4

out of the detriment of Twitter. But I see this like festival of the commons of Farcaster is when somebody triggers, invents like some cool new mechanism that's brand new, that can become an app on top of the Farcaster protocol and actually grow the utility of the protocol at large. And hopefully that is what unlocks a brand new like Cambrian explosion of cool new social features that exists on the internet. Is that what you see? Yeah, and so going back to, I would give TikTok as probably the one counter example to the last 10 years. But other than that, and maybe Snap, if you wanna go back that far, but very few, right? I think the way to think about client competition on something like Farcaster, so let's, you know, someone comes up with the Clubhouse equivalent on Farcaster and we have this initial client and has a lot of users. And so if we try to do the same thing that Twitter did with Spaces, right? The advantage Twitter had with Spaces is not Spaces was a better product, Spaces had more distribution, right? So if you do a Spaces for Bankless versus a Clubhouse for Bankless, you already have a huge audience on Twitter, right? And so I can guarantee you if YouTube did a Spaces product or I guess do they have it, it's like YouTube Live, but something equivalent, it would also be really popular because there's a lot of existing users and distribution. And I think what's key with Farcaster is, so if someone goes and clones, you know, one of the bigger apps on the ecosystem clones, the kind of up and coming, the one who innovated, they have to continue to keep pace because the distribution is actually put at the protocol level. So now as a user, if I actually wanna listen to the equivalent of a like, you know, audio room that is at the Farcaster protocol level, I can actually choose the best client rather than have to say, oh, do I wanna choose the distribution or the feature set? And so you can actually get both where the client that you opt into has the feature set, but you can still have access to the entire social graph and in distribution. And so going back to this idea of monopolistic tendencies, it forces clients to actually have to be extremely responsive to users because otherwise someone's going to get their attention, right? And so from our standpoint, look, we have, you know, 99% market share today because we're the initial client. There are a whole bunch of other clients being built right now. And as we build the ecosystem out and make it easy for users to actually move between clients, I consider it a huge success if we only end up having 10 or 20% share, assuming we've grown the Farcaster protocol because that to me is the success of the protocol. And then we're gonna end up with a better ecosystem because these apps are gonna be competing on feature set, not distribution and like proprietary lock-in where I think that that's where we've gotten a lot of, the reason things are so stagnant, right? Instagram had this whole controversy recently where they're adding more videos to compete with TikTok. And you had a whole bunch of users, a lot of high profile users even being like, we don't like this. Like we want to have it be more like the traditional Instagram where it's photos or stories. And the beauty of a system like Farcaster is if the equivalent of Instagram is built on Farcaster and has a massive audience, assuming it's on the protocol, you can actually go build the traditional Instagram client, which actually someone did. And what did Instagram do? They sued them for access to the API and then got them kicked out of the app store. Whereas in this system, it'll be like, oh, this is a better client. I'm gonna go shift over there. And two examples like this exist in the web one world. So the first is browsers. Netscape starts it, Internet Explorer crushes them through a variety of kind of underhanded tactics through bundling. And then what happens is Firefox comes out and Firefox without any huge budget or anything wins a massive amount of market share on the merit of just being a better browser. And the beauty of the web is I can go, there was no lock-in of IE for the most part. And then Google comes along and says, well, we're gonna build a better browser than Firefox and got a lot of share. Whereas now with these mobile app stores, essentially Apple and Google can actually force and actually more Apple than Google, cause I think Android's a little bit more open here. Apple basically can say we're the only the browser on iOS. Like Chrome is like basically this wrapper on top of some APIs, but they don't get like full system access. And then the second one is superhuman can come along and just be like, we are literally giving you the same effective set of data that exists on Gmail, but we're gonna build a product that's so productive for the people who are excited about that. And we're gonna charge $30 a month or whatever they charge. And they can go do that because email by definition is kind of this permissionless thing where I can actually move my data between different clients. And so that's what we wanna get to with Fargaster where the best clients, the biggest clients are winning on the merits of their features, not some lock-in that they then can kind of extract. Like the classic example I always use with web two if it's not even social is Airbnb's cleaning fees. They're able to do that because it's like they've built this huge marketplace and brand and most consumers aren't gonna go try to go find the other things that exist out there. And so then they can kind of just keep turning the dial and not having to really respond to the market versus if you imagine that as a protocol, right? Like the ability to have the inventory as a protocol and then the trust and safety, which is actually the hard thing to go do. But if you can actually get that to a protocol and I haven't even thought about like how you'd actually go do that. But imagine if that was more of a protocol, then you'd have the best clients all competing on it, right? And that's actually in some ways, if you think about flights, a much better example where you used to have Hitmonk and Expedia and Kayak and Google flights, like people can actually compete on that data set. And that's not even a protocol, but it's just like having open access to data, you win on the merits of how functional the software you're building is, not some proprietary lock-in. So this all makes sense, but here's the question I'm trying to understand in my mind, Dan. So why? Let's go back to incentives, right? So Twitter certainly could have in the early days of Twitter not shut off its API, okay? It could have been a bit more standard centric and protocol centric in its design. Sure, it didn't have crypto, but it could have adopted for some kind of open standards. It could have made itself more rugless. But the reason they didn't is because they had, back to David's point earlier, they had venture capitalists, investors to please. And the model, the monetization model for social is ads. And so once they established their moat, right? It was a good business decision to then pick up the ladder and pull it up so that no one could kind of come behind them. They had no incentive to create this protocol behind them and to let competitors out innovate them because they were incented towards an advertising model in order to maximize the ROI for their investors. We understand this, this is kind of capitalism. And I can imagine forecasters not using sort of a Wikipedia model where it's purely like grants funded. That's the other example of how we've created kind of public goods on the internet. So can you tell me about the kind of the incentive mechanism? I mean, you've been talking about how you're very excited to propagate the forecaster protocol and not just the forecaster client. But then what further incentive do you have to continue building that protocol, I suppose? Or like, don't you want to be the most dominant client in the space? Are you planning to monetize this with ads? This is the part I don't understand is how do investors in something like forecaster maintain alignment? How do you yourself, your team maintain alignment? You were talking about, I would love to develop our client forever, like for as long as I can. Why? What is the monetization? What is the incentive mechanism here that keeps you aligned with the public good and the good of the protocol? Does my question even make sense? Yeah, it makes a total amount of sense. And I think that the answer is one, I can give you the most glib or whatever crafted answer. And this is something that is only earned through actions over a sustained period of time that people actually believe that I do care about the protocol or Varun and I care about making the protocol successful and not just our company is called Merkel Manufactory. So making Merkel successful. And so the way we approached it is one, Varun and I both worked at Coinbase. So we had some economic success coming out of Coinbase. And when we sat down to kind of like work on potential ideas, we were both aligned on wanting to work on something for 10 plus years and actually have it be meaningful and great to the point where we could look back when we were 80 and say, I'm really proud that I worked on that. There was only another companies we could have gone worked on letter kind of like very nuts and bolts SAS companies in crypto and probably could have grown it faster and gotten to revenue faster or whatever. We just didn't opt for that. We wanted to work on something for 10 plus years that we wanted people to actually kind of say that that's stupid that you're working on that. Like it's never gonna work. Because I think when you have long time horizons you can actually accomplish great things. The second thing is we bootstrapped the company for the first year and a half, not because of lack of investor interest is that we actually wanted to build the initial version of Forecaster and how we wanted to build it in the way we wanted to. Because again, we're aligned on the long-term here. When we did raise money last year and we raised money because one, we thought being able to scale the team a little bit more than we had originally planned would benefit the protocol. But two, I got a sense having been through multiple crypto winters at Coinbase that we were headed into a down market. So we started fundraising end of April, early May of last year, right before things imploded. So we got lucky on the time. But one of the things is we said to all the investors that we brought on board is we're optimizing for the protocol long-term and Varun and I have, you know, kind of voting control of the company. So like basically we're in the driver's seat around we can build the company the way we wanna do it. And our view, going back to that kind of analogy is today we have 99% market share or 95, whatever version of that high number you wanna pick. But we have 8,000 people in a beta. The goal here is to get to a hundred million, a billion people on Farcaster. And if we have 10%, in those two cases, you have 10 million or a hundred million users. Like that is gonna be great. And so I think that you have to earn the trust of the developer community within the Farcaster ecosystem. That I think will be majorly earned when we release hubs because then people will actually start to believe like, wait a second, like I have the same playing field access to the data and APIs that Merkle does with the amount of money that they raise, the fact that they were the first in the ecosystem, they have the most users. And it seems like Merkle is taking their API or their limited resources in terms of time and staff and building out features to like make it easy for an app developer to install. You can easily install a new Farcaster app and actually letting people export to a new client. And so upholding that standard. But I don't think that there's any deterministic way for anyone to believe that other than if we've been working on it for three, four years and we've consistently made, not perfect, but consistently made the right long-term decisions around optimizing for the protocol. And so that's the best answer I can give you is like, I believe it and I wanna show the world that I do, but until we hit a sufficient scale and hubs exist, I think it's completely reasonable for anyone to be skeptical. Dan, is it required that a protocol have a token for this to succeed? So I've just, we've used some analogs of the Ethereum foundation, for example, right? And basically if I were to kind of sum up the Ethereum foundation and what's done is it's bootstrapped it's R&D development based on the value of ETH, the token. And at some point the idea is that ETH maybe ossifies in some way. And actually ossify is not the right term, David, was the other term we were batting around? Homeostasis. It goes into homeostasis. Homeostatic. Where there's less development, ongoing development needed. And so kind of the Ethereum foundation is almost no longer needed as sort of a shepherd and kind of goes feeds into the background, but they've used the token price to kind of stay aligned with the rest of the ecosystem. So they're very aligned with, Arbitrum and Optimism, Layer 2, is anyone in DeFi because they have kind of that alignment in the token. Is a token needed in order to align parties for something like a decentralized social network? Or what do you think of that? So the way I think about it is the protocol, going back to your idea of like, how do you bootstrap R&D and continue to have a strong protocol that's independent? Protocol needs a source of revenue. And so the way we are going to actually test this is once we move to mainnet, we are actually going to have two types of forecaster accounts. There's an account that you can kind of register. Think of it as like you get a numerical ID and you own that forever. It's gas only, one time. So you could do that once and then you have a forecaster account forever. But we think that most people who are engaged on forecaster are going to actually be willing to pay some amount of money. We're going to test it at roughly $10 a year worth of Ethereum directly to a contract that is kind of like the protocol treasury contract. And if we're right about that hypothesis, could be wrong, but if we're right, then the protocol is actually going to have a sustainable yearly revenue source into perpetuity. That's something that email doesn't have or DNS or any of these other things that were kind of more academic and then got captured by a lot of the large internet companies. And so by having a revenue source of the protocol, now the protocol can actually start to hire its own team and actually get outside of like whether Merkle Manufacturer or other big companies in the space are actively contributing to protocol. Like we still want to, but like I want to get to a place where the protocol can actually really be independent. And then at that point, I think it's worth figuring out depending on how many users you have and how engaged people are, is how do you actually decentralize the core governance of that strategy away from the initial team? And so I have like kind of this very pragmatic or give myself credit on the pragmatism. I'm rooted in pragmatism most of the time. And my view is if we focus on the decentralization of the governance too early, we're going to spend way more time talking about like what the systems and processes should be versus actually making progress. And the thing that matters is like, we need to have a million or 10 million people who've signed up for this thing and proving people are willing to pay for the protocol and all this other stuff before we can worry about getting to those other things. Again, people might say- You don't want, never want to lead with algorithms. That's a bad idea. Right, you're just going to move slower. And so for our, like there's a term in open source software development, which is not what we want to do, but benevolent dictator for life. That's what Linus Torvalds says. Right. So we want to be ours is benevolent dictator until product market fit and then actually turn it over to the protocol. And look, some people will say, oh, well, what's your incentive? You're going to get there and you're going to want to, you know, hold on to control. Yeah, that would be the big corner response. But the reality is if I wanted to do control, why would I be spending all this time on the protocol stuff? Like I could be moving way faster. 50, 80% of my engineering resources on the team right now are spent on the protocol. And so like, this is the thing. I don't have to convince everyone on this. All I have to convince are an increasing number, small but steady group of people who are like buying into the vibe on Farcaster. And that's fine. Because if we can continue to show that we can grow it, we will get more and more permissionless over time. And I'm fine with that. And so I'm not walking around saying Farcaster is permissionless and all this stuff. That is aspirational at this point. But when we hit that bar, I'll be very happy to kind of pound my chest and say, hey, we've hit these milestones. And we do have actually a lot of decentralization and it is ruthless. But until then it's more aspirational and it's like we're actively investing resources in it. But I don't think it's intellectually honest for anyone to be claiming that if you haven't actually hit the threshold. No, that's cool. That's pretty grounded. Yeah, that was kind of the root of my question, right? Because like what you're looking for if you're doing a protocol is sort of a public sector and a private sector, right? And both need to be funded. And if we think about kind of governments, everyone's familiar with, obviously their nation state and they're familiar with taxes and then they're familiar with businesses. And so what you're saying is basically the Farcaster protocol could be configured in such a way that it has some sort of lightweight tax type system to pay for the public goods, which is maybe when you register your name or something, it was $10 in ETH per year. And this goes into a fund. And if you multiply that by large number of users, then you actually have a pretty good tax base in order to fund the public goods, the roads and the hospitals, of course, not those things literally in this case, but the public goods that everyone will share. Now, what you haven't figured out, which to be fair, no one in crypto has figured this out, is how to actually govern that treasury and make sure that it's managed effectively. Of course, like in the nation state, quite famously have large bureaucracies that sort of kind of do this work. Maybe crypto will develop something around that though. That's kind of the hope. I mean, we are working on these Gitcoin type governance, quadratic voting types of things, and something might come along. But that was the root of my question. So in a fully realized forecaster, you have this public sector, but then you have this private sector of all of these various clients that are creating businesses based on the public infrastructure and are competing with one another in a way, but they're also contributing towards the network effect of the protocol. And even they're contributing tax revenue to the protocol to the extent they're able to onboard users. That seems to me like a pretty grounded approach and does not necessarily require a token at the base layer. Although maybe that's a design strategy as well when you think about governance. Very helpful. Thank you. Yeah, and I think in some ways it's an improvement on Web1, which you always have to be careful about because like obviously Web1 has been incredibly successful. But I do think if you think about whether it's, I don't know, HTTP, DNS, SMTP, the fact that those protocols don't have a built-in revenue source despite billions of people using them. You have to run them as nonprofits that don't have any funding whatsoever, basically. Or get funding from the big internet companies who then get to decide what the standards are and what we want to work on. 100%. Things like that. Right, and so like a good example of like WebAuthn, which is like this new like touchless way of signing into things, they don't allow like arbitrary signing of like ECDSA curves or whatever. And if you wanted to actually get that done, it's this incredibly bureaucratic process run by kind of middle management at like the biggest browser manufacturers. And in a world where governance is a little bit more decentralized and like there is actually a revenue source directly to the protocol, one, the protocol hopefully is independent so that it can actually make its own decisions what's best for the protocol. But more importantly, if you actually get to a good solution for decentralized governance, if you want to have more influence there, you're gonna figure out, okay, this is the path to actually doing that versus this kind of opaque, big company. Like the fact that Microsoft, Apple, and Google can kind of get together and be like, eh, maybe we won't add this feature to the web browsers. And people will be like, oh, that's this conspiracy theory. And then it turned out like when Steve Jobs was around, they weren't recruiting engineers from each other because like big companies do do that. So I don't know, like I think, call me naive, but I do think having these public goods have a funding source is a improvement over the status quo. Oh, actually, I agree. As long as we can govern them effectively in a uncorruptible way. I guess just last piece here, then back to kind of the business model for a second. So remember that public private kind of.

# 155 - The Rise of Decentralized Social Networks with Farcaster’s Dan Romero [nGDIdbdtdjE]_part5

relationship we just described, and the clients themselves would be the private sector here. And I suppose you would be open to all sorts of new models on the client side that Web3 enables. So back to my early example of Twitter, the only model, the only way for them to appease their shareholders and make money and return value to the investors, which is necessary, by the way, let's not live in a naive world where investors invest in things without expectation of maximizing their upside. But you could have things that aren't maybe ad revenue funded, for example, in the clients. So NFTs, like a client, you can imagine a forecaster, maybe you'll get some kind of transaction fee type revenue for the amount of posts or the amount of NFTs that are sold inside of the client. Or maybe there's some other token funding apparatus that is more Web3 native and less eyeball centric. We make money based on the number of eyeballs we get in this system. So I guess that private sector is even more diverse than the Web3 social, which just depends on attention as the currency, depends on advertising as the sponsor of everything, where all users become the product. Yeah. So I fully expect there to be clients in the forecaster ecosystem that use advertising. It's the reveal preference of billions of consumers, they like free and they're willing to have their attention taken by an ad. I don't think all ads are bad either. But I think what we're planning to do with our client, so I can speak to that, is we're going to have a freemium model. So we're going to actually have subscriptions. And our strategy is to keep our team extremely small, like from a core team. So our general expenses are going to be pretty low. And we think that within a reasonable number of years in terms of growth, we continue to grow 5% every week, we will get to a place where we're break even or profitable based on some percentage of users willing to subscribe for the kind of like pro subscription. And I think subscriptions in 2022 are much more normalized for consumers to say, hey, I'm actually spending a lot of time in this app. I'm willing to subscribe a few dollars a month to the more kind of like premium version of that. And so that's something we're going to test. I think you're spot on in that if your feed has a bunch of stuff that's happening on chain, there's a natural economic model with that. And one example I always bring up, a lot of people don't realize, Apple gets paid $20 billion a year by Google for the default search placement in Safari on iOS. So that's probably their highest. It's $20 billion? $20 to $0 billion. And that's got to be pretty profitable. It's their highest profit margin line of business. There's no cost. It's literally, it's just, you know, you can either be DuckDuckGo, Bing or Google and Google pays $20 billion. It's a real estate. Because you can change it. It's not like it's like the only option. And so that's an amazing model when you have some amount of scale, right? Like, you know, obviously Apple has a lot of scale, but Firefox's entire budget basically is just the fact that they have the user base that they do. And Google pays to be the default little search bar in Firefox. And so, and now you realize why Chrome is so valuable because they don't have to pay themselves that. But in our case, we have the NFTs. You can imagine our client saying, okay, what's the default? If you click on a link in an NFT, where does it go? And now you potentially have different marketplaces being willing to bid on that. Or if you mentioned a cryptocurrency, it's like, where are you going to trade it? And so I think the idea space for this kind of like transaction-based commerce is something that was frankly, and maybe Elon fixes this with Twitter. I don't want to count them out. But Twitter is this kind of like feed of information and the ability for you to like tap in two things and then buy a recommended, you know, someone tweets a link to the wire cutter. Like why isn't there a deal where you're surfacing that product review right in the feed? Not oppressively, it's like, I'm interested in this click, it opens up and then I can actually do the commerce right there. I think that there's just a whole idea space that can happen there. And then the beauty is people are inventing new things in crypto all the time that are going to have natural built-in economic models. And so what I would like to get to is a place where basically we never have to have ads because we figured out other ways to monetize and also kept our cost structure really lean. But even at that case, like you can imagine maybe when we have 10 million or a hundred million people, there's a tier of user that's like, hey, I actually just want the bare bones completely free. And then maybe you're showing them some simple ad. But like by no means are we interested in doing that in the near term. And here's the beauty of the protocol. If that's the wrong decision, some other app is going to come along, offer all the same features they're going to offer an ad-based client and the reveal preference of users will that they'll use it and then we'll have to confront and potentially change that. So I think that that is a world that I want to live in where we can run these experiments and let the market decide rather than, you know, you make a decision 14 years ago. And actually I think with Twitter now that they're not public and they're owned by one person, they're actually having an opportunity to rethink that business model. And if you were to ask me what is a Twitter that is not owned by Elon today, it's they made the bold decision early on that they weren't going to monetize like Facebook. And instead they were going to say, Hey, we're going to monetize better than any online newspaper. Right. Because we know these people who are really into Twitter, probably willing to pay 20, $30 a month. And maybe they didn't have 6,000 people. They had 1200 people or whatever. But I think from first principles, I think you can get to a reasonable, profitable business with a subscription model that you don't even assume most people subscribe to. Like assuming you just are really, really efficient in terms of keeping your head count lean. Dan, this has been such a great exploration into the world of the future of social media networks and I'm pretty sure listeners or imaginations are probably running wild right now. There's a few more conversations I just want to quickly check the box of just to, as we wrap this up. One is like, what is the actual on-chain footprint of this thing? Like it's not its own blockchain, correct? And I want to make sure that that gets communicated, but what are the actual crypto things that are about Farcaster? What is its footprint in the world of crypto? Yeah, so you have two parts on-chain. Today it's on Ethereum testnet, it's on Gurley, and it's moving to mainnet hopefully halfway through this year. And you sign up, you get an FID, a Farcaster ID, and it's just an incrementing number. So if you're the 10,000 user, that's your number. That's largely abstract away from people, but that's actually critical for the whole system to work. Then there's an optional $10 a year kind of like username, like kind of premium account, and effectively that those are the two primitives that is also an NFT. So that can actually be permissions to put into anything in ERC721 works with. OpenSea, you can put it on, I don't know, PseudoSwap, you can use it with PartyBid, completely composable. So wait, my account is an NFT? Yes. I hope you got a good username there, David. Well, I hope I don't lose it. No, no, no, you won't lose it. Any active user during the testnet, we're going to migrate to mainnet on our dime. But then it's $10 a year, just like it would be if you own a domain to pay and you pay directly to the protocol. But yeah, that is the core primitive on Ethereum, relatively simple set of smart contracts. But the core of the whole system is all mapped to that. So if I post something from DWR, which is my username, every time that happens, there are servers that are effectively checking Ethereum to make sure that the public key, which is an Ethereum address, matches the private key that signs that content. And it all just magically works. And then the other question I want to talk about is the world of content moderation and spam prevention. As someone who has been absolutely hounded by Twitter bots lately, how does spam prevention work in a decentralized network? Like, aren't you just opening yourself up to spam attacks? So one of the things, again, small team, and we're just trying to focus on what we think are the most important priorities first, is it's gated to sign up. And we actually took inspiration from Facebook on this. Facebook is still the largest social network in the world. And for the first two, two and a half years, it was gated to.edu email addresses. And our approach is we need to get hubs out, we need to get to Ethereum mainnet. And then the second half of this year, it's figure out how do you get to completely permissionless onboarding. And then I think you start to hit a bar where, okay, the protocol is actually permissionless. But as a result of that, we haven't had any spam issues for the most part, because everyone right now has to come through my Twitter DM. And that's not sustainable long-term, we're moving away from that. But I think that that's allowed us to A, keep the community small and incrementally grow rather than have it grow too fast, people kind of turn and then it feels like a ghost town. And I think the long-term solution, and this is not fully baked, so there's a little bit of a punt here, but I think the high-level answer is something like PageRank, which powers Google is as the social network develops and you've kind of had time for kind of the active users, you can actually start to map any given user on the network, how they interact with all the other users. And it gets very difficult for a spammy account to penetrate the core of the network in a way that if you basically get good on your kind of machine learning, data science, you could potentially even publish that information so that any client out of the box can get actually decent spam filtering with the caveat that that client can choose, hey, actually I don't think this account is spammy or whatever. So they can modulate how they want to approach content moderation. I also think that what's important is similar to email, which everyone uses content moderation in email, which is called spam filtering. It's a client level decision versus the network level decision, which is relatively straightforward. The only thing you can store on Farcaster is texts, like 320 character little tweets like things. And so the amount of stuff that you can actually put on there that is really bad from like an image standpoint and video content is relatively limited. That said, you could still put some nasty stuff in 320 characters, but inevitably what you're going to have is you're going to have clients are going to do the same thing they would do with emails is they're going to say, okay, we're going to not allow hate speech or abuse or all this other stuff. But that will again be a client level feature, which is how the internet works, right? It's like how the web works. Like Google doesn't have to index your webpage, but that doesn't mean your webpage went offline. So even if it's full of deplorable stuff, Google just takes it out of the index. You just get no distribution. And I think that that is the content moderation gets wrapped up in the fact that today, most of the platforms we're talking about from a content moderation standpoint are doing the hosting. They have the identity for their given platform and the distribution. And so thus they have to do content moderation because then people are like, well, why are you hosting this video? Or why is that tweet still up? Where the reality is if you have a marketplace of clients, first of all, there's no single omni algorithm, right? Like each client's going to have a different way that they're implementing that. And B, I think the average user does want some amount of content moderation. But like when we have a marketplace of ways of solving it, we call it spam filtering, right? So we're talking about platforms on low quality versus this, like, is this fundamentally something that should be posted or not? I don't think most people are that worried about like the fact that there are some really kooky websites out there on the internet, but if they don't have any distribution, it doesn't really matter. Right. Yeah. And that kind of just answers my next question, which was like discoverability and the algorithm, right? The reason why we bankless post videos to YouTube is because the YouTube algorithm allows us to be discoverable. But I'm going to go ahead and guess that the future web three protocol version of this is the same answer that it was for spam prevention. It's just like that is a vector upon which the clients compete upon and discoverability and whose algorithm is best, whose algorithm is most enjoyable by people and makes them feel good is probably something that the client layer competes upon. And it's also probably the way that Farcaster also becomes like compliant with nation state regulations is that clients are going to have to like make sure that no illicit activity is happening on them. But that doesn't, that's no longer responsibility of the protocol. Like the protocol is permissionless, but clients still got to make sure that the activity inside of the specific client is like not going to trigger the ire of regulators. If it's like, you know, illicit trades or, you know, all the bad things that happen on the internet, that is still something that the clients have to optimize for and work on that the protocol doesn't leaving the protocol still like peer and permissionless. Yeah, it's very similar to Coinbase, right? Like Coinbase has to keep things clean on their end and they're subject to the laws in the countries they operate in. But the blockchain is a protocol and what happens on there, they have to take care of what interacts with them. And I think that that is the right approach because it works really well for the web and email. And I think we have the possibility if we can achieve what we want to achieve with Forecaster for actually making the same for social. And I do think on the algorithm side, if you view that, like, let's say that there are five or 10 major apps and they all have a slightly different algorithm, instead of hacking the algorithm, which is a lot of like what happens on these like monopolistic networks, you actually get to a place where the best content across a variety of different algorithms is probably actually what succeeds, right? Because it's hard to fake quality versus any one algorithm probably can be gamed, but it's harder to fake 10 at a time. Dan, this could probably be this question I'm about to ask you could probably be an entire podcast. So we don't want to do that. But it's one thing I just wanted to cover before we close here and we're getting ready to. So we've been having on Bankless this conversation about identity and a quote from kind of Bankless. The Bankless thesis is phase one, we take back our money. Phase two, we take back our identity. And social certainly has a role in web three in phase two, I think. How does this fit with the story of identity? How does Farcaster kind of feed into that? We just had the folks from Signing with Ethereum on the podcast. People can look at that in the archive, Bankless listeners, in like maybe 45 seconds or so, could you could you help us answer that question? Does this play a role in decentralized identity in that story? I think it does. I think, look, you can today and Vitalik is a great example of this, you can have your own website, and that can kind of be the primary pointer to your identity in the internet. The challenge is your website is going to have a very hard time in a very rare cases, getting distribution. And I think more people will be willing to actually start with a sovereign identity, something that they really do control and can kind of instantiate their identity or display their identity in any way they want, if they can associate it with distribution. And so I think with Farcaster or other kind of decentralized identity approaches, if you basically can have that be the pivot point, assuming that you can then get distribution for whatever you're trying to say or achieve in the world, I think that is the most promising path because, you know, like distribution is the thing that people care about, right? It's the reason as many of the people who are interested in decentralized social media and you know, all the things that Farcaster represents, that they still continue to use Twitter is because they already have large audiences there. And I can't fault them for it. Like that, that's actually a hard thing to do is build an audience and distribution. And so if we can do our part in making it easier to have a decentralized way of connecting with a large group of people, then I think you'll start to get sovereign identity. This is great. Bankless listeners. Hope you enjoyed this conversation with Dan. He's building a decentralized social network protocol called Farcaster. Of course, it's one of a couple that we will be a few, I should say, that we're exploring on Bankless and we certainly wish you well on your endeavors, Dan. This has been a fun conversation. Thank you for introing us to decentralized social media and also to Farcaster. Thanks for having me. And I'm happy to offer Bankless listeners a Farcaster account. Are you sure about that, sir? Because you know, you're about to get a lot of DMs. How about this? We'll keep it to the Bankless Nation Discord. The first hundred people who send me a message with the word in it, I'll put a little filter in my Twitter DM inbox. I'll know they have listened to the end of the podcast. Dan, is it okay if we beep that word out and only have that go out on the premium feed? There you go. That's the benefit of the premium subscription. So we've just beeped the word out. So if you want to unlock that beep, then go become a Bankless premium member and we'll save Dan's DM so he doesn't hear from the full Bankless community. Just the premium bankers. That's real proof of work. I guess that's probably not the right word on the podcast. Proof of listenership. Proof of shake. There you go. That's awesome. Well, we appreciate it, Dan. This has been a lot of fun. Thanks so much. Thanks for having me. I'm going to go turn off the cameras, guys. Got to end with this, of course. Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in, but we're headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey. First we take back our money, then we take back our identity. Thanks a lot. Hey, we hope you enjoyed the video.

# Building Social Graphs as Protocols, Not Companies [fW9-dEOSX8A]_part1

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for sticking around. I know it's late in the day and you're getting tired. Hopefully you've got some caffeine. I've got with me Dan Romero, who we've had the good fortune of investing in his new business called Farcaster a few months ago. I talked a little earlier today about Farcaster in my presentation, separating front ends and back ends and social media. Dan is super ambitious and super thoughtful in the process he's going to take to change the world and make all this stuff a reality. So let's jump in, Dan. Let's start with just like, can you share your background? How'd you get into this? Sure. So early employee and executive at Coinbase. I was there for five years. I've been told I'm a crypto boomer since I've been working in the space since 2014. I was originally responsible for all the fiat on ramps. So most of the fiat on ramps in the US I was the first customer of. And then the kind of second half of my time there, I ran the consumer business. So Coinbase is retail division. So you left Coinbase a couple years ago or something, and maybe a year ago, and you've been thinking a lot about what to do next. You ultimately chose to build Farcaster, decentralized social media identity. Why? Yeah, so I still was super interested in crypto once I left Coinbase, but took a full survey of everything happening in Silicon Valley. And crypto still kind of was top of my list in terms of interest. I think that the primary reason is it feels like where the frontier is from permissionless innovation standpoint. I think actually up until recently, AI really has only been in the kind of like, you know, big Google or Facebook world of big centralized companies, big budgets. And if you kind of found that marginal college age developer who was hacking on something, they were doing it in crypto. And that was the thing that brought me to Silicon Valley originally. And as I kind of approached, okay, what to build in crypto, the thing that's always kind of been kicking around in the back of my mind was we've had a lot of financial applications, which makes sense. Money is kind of the first application of cryptocurrencies. But we haven't had a ton of social or kind of information oriented projects. And the thing that originally got me interested in technology to begin with was I was a early user of RSS, power user of Twitter. I was one of the first developers on the Twitter API back in the day. And I've just always been enamored with this idea that the internet, if you have a good idea, internet connection, you can build whatever you want without any permission. And so in kind of taking those two interests together led ultimately to asking a question kind of like, how could you prove RSS, which I think, you know, we talked about before, and ultimately started working on Farcaster. Okay, so what is Farcaster? Yeah, so Farcaster is a sufficiently decentralized social network. It's also a protocol. And it guarantees two things. So users have a direct relationship with their audience. So if you kind of think about Twitter, you build a following on Twitter or YouTube, and they are the kind of intermediary between you and any of your followers or subscribers. So at their whim, you can disappear and you lose that audience. Compare that to something like email, where if you have an email list with something like Substack or MailChimp, one of those providers kicks you off, you can move to another provider and still communicate with your audience. So Farcaster, that's a strong guarantee for anyone using the social network. The other guarantee on the developer side is that a developer is always going to have access to the underlying data and APIs in a way that if you, again, compare it to a centralized social media, in the kind of early 2010s, Twitter had a very permissive open API ecosystem. Actually, all of their mobile clients were third party API clients. And at a certain point, they just changed the terms of service and overnight kind of killed a whole bunch of independent businesses. Facebook also took this approach in the early days, with the most prominent example being Zynga built a meaningful business on top of Facebook. And then within a six month period, Facebook changed the rules, decided they wanted to focus more on monetization, less on apps, and Zynga's business got kneecapped. So with Farcaster, there is no ability for a corporate entity to change the rules of the API. So you as a developer can build a business where you have surety into, hopefully, perpetuity that if you're building on Farcaster, you can have that direct relationship with the protocol itself, not some other company. You all say there's a Farcaster back end, or maybe back end, and there's a front end. Are those things together, or are they separated? Like, super high level overview. Yeah, so we've taken an approach which I think is somewhat different than a lot of the maybe competing Web 3 social protocols, in that we've built both the initial client, so the user interface that the people in our beta are using, and then the actual underlying protocol and data. And by separating that, I think we've achieved two things. One, it puts a level playing field that if anyone else wants to actually go build a competing client, they can. And then the other approach with building the client, which I think is the different part, is that we are actually dogfooding our own protocol. So we're the first people from a developer standpoint to run into the problems and the limitations of the protocol. So it kind of gives us a pretty big incentive to make sure that we're upgrading the protocol. And then whatever we're doing to upgrade benefits the entire ecosystem. So you said you're building the first client for Farcaster. Are there other clients yet? Yeah, so we have a few. So we've been working on it about two years. For the first year, there was no developer interest whatsoever. So we kind of continued to make week over week progress with our own client, trying to figure out people who would use the beta. And then I'd say in the last four to six months, we've had a steady stream, and it's growing at a pretty good rate of developers starting to hack around. And I think that the primary reason was at the beginning, there's just not enough data. It's not interesting, you know, 10 people using the app a day. Whereas we're kind of coming in closer to 1,000 people using the app a day. And with that scale, it's actually generating a sufficient amount of data. You think about the posts, the likes, the profiles, the follows, that a developer can now actually just permissionlessly access all of the data, similar to a cryptocurrency blockchain, and build whatever they want. And so actually one of the first applications that has been built, and it's sort of a client, it's slightly different than how we're presenting it. Our client looks very similar to Twitter. But the kind of like first meaningful client has been a search engine, right? We didn't have native search built into our client. People were annoyed by that. And rather than complaining to us, someone just went and built it. And so it's called Searchcaster. Everyone kind of names everything Caster in the ecosystem. But it's actually meaningful traffic. And one of the things that we're actually considering, because again, we're building both the protocol and the client, and have to have a slightly different mental approach compared to a Web 2 company, is we don't look at Searchcaster and the growth there and say, oh, we need to bring this in-house, and we need to have our own search engine. What we're trying to figure out is how can we actually channel the kind of user distribution, the people who are using our client, into that search engine in a way that, if you think about a browser, when you use your iPhone and you go into Safari, the default search engine is Google. And you can actually switch that to Yahoo or DuckDuckGo in settings. Most people don't, primarily because they want to use Google. But Google also is willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year. Most people don't realize that. Apple's in the search business. They just get paid $20 billion a year by Google, and they don't have to run any infrastructure, just for being the default. And so I think that that's like a pretty powerful idea to say, if you focus on the client, which is much more akin to a browser, you can actually, hopefully, create an ecosystem of independent businesses that can actually leverage the distribution that you have while also building to the health of the protocol. There's certain things that you explicitly do not want to do in-house that you want the community to do. And then to what extent do you say that explicitly and publicly? And just think about kind of the in-house versus external development roadmap. Yeah, it's something that we're trying to figure out. For the first year, it didn't matter. No one was building on the protocol. And I think now there's a term in the developer world. It's called Sherlocking. And it refers to what Apple does is every year at WWDC when they announce their new iOS, there's a set of apps that just get kind of folded in. So the weather app, the flashlight app, like all of the features that in modern iOS just come with the phone used to be third-party apps. And so that's actually something we're really cognizant of. I don't know if I have the best answer for you in the sense that I think when we see developer interest outside of the app, we're actually trying to frame it as, OK, how can we actually enable this developer to actually grow their app, their business with users in a way that benefits them while at the same time deepening engagement in forecast for the protocol overall? And so a good example of this is we have a couple of services that have popped up that are bookmarking. Our version of tweets are called casts. And sometimes someone posts something that's insightful, and someone wants to bookmark it to be able to refer to it later. And so rather than building the bookmarking feature internally, we're trying to figure out, can we actually expose maybe an API from our client that you can choose your preferred bookmarking service and make that one click within the app? Maybe you're familiar with Chrome extensions, so something like that but on mobile, but make it really easy for the consumer to use. But now you're simultaneously using our client, but you're also benefiting a third-party developer. It's almost like a plug-in kind of a thing, like built into. Exactly. And you have to be really careful with that because Apple does not want app stores within app stores. It's actually one of the biggest things. If you look at most of the mobile wallets, I was at Coinbase, Apple reviews every single screen, and any time they think that the word DAP to them is absolutely unacceptable because that's an app within an app, you have to get kind of creative in how you do this. But I think that the frame of plug-ins and extensions might actually kind of pass that sniff test because you're not emphasizing an app within an app, but more you're extending the functionality of an existing app. Right. So one thing that I talked about in my presentation earlier today about credible users or backends was I highlighted Twitter specifically and I said, look, there's all these different use cases for Twitter. You've got music Twitter, crypto Twitter, fin Twit, whatever. They all do different things. There's some overlap in those communities, but they're also fairly functionally distinct as well. We talked in our due diligence with you about how do you unbundle Twitter, what use cases do you go after first? So how do you think about that? Where's Farcaster today on those fronts? Yeah, it's a question I get from most people who, once they start to use Farcaster and they're kind of curious, they'll ping me and they'll say, well, how are you going to get normies to use this? And I think our approach is... Who's using it today before we get to the normies? Yeah, well, so that's what I was going to say is I actually go back to them and say, I don't care about normal users. Normal users will come once you win the... So I think of social status is the way these public social networks work. The number one group of people that I want to win are basically crypto oriented folks who are using Twitter today and using Twitter in an intellectual capacity. So they're actually kind of trying to spread mimetic, like they have a thought idea of like, okay, here's how to value a cryptocurrency or here's how someone should develop some type of new application that plays well with a very sub segment of Twitter. But actually, if you go back to the early days of Twitter, that's actually the origin of Twitter. And so I think that for us, the market to win is any developer who is interested in crypto, who also kind of wants to be in that kind of public arena from an intellectual standpoint. And if you just really build a product for those people, you know, on the order of 100,000 or a million people using that product, which call it in the next one or two years, you could reasonably get there, you start to actually draw in more normal people, right? So first, it'll be kind of tech adjacent investor types who are like, okay, I want to know what's going on in the frontier. Some of you might follow someone like Balaji Srinivasan, who's kind of talking to a very specific audience over here, but bleeds over into, I think, an investor class of folks. And so if you can actually get the kind of folks who are upstream of that discussion using a platform, and they find it higher quality and for a variety of reasons, then you're not really going to start to bring in what I would call more normal users. And it's actually a very similar model. If you think about how Facebook scaled, started Harvard, go to Ivy League, go to.edu, then eventually go to the rest of the world. And if you actually kind of think about it, the moment Facebook opened up from.edu, it was actually the beginning of the end for Facebook, but they had concentrated such a high amount of quality, and quality is a proxy here of just like educated American students, that the half-life of that growth got them to 2 billion users, right? Because the moment it opened up to everybody else, college students were like, this is no longer cool, you know, Snapchat comes along, Instagram, other things. But those growth curves can actually last for a really long time if you really, really focus on a concentration of high status individuals at the beginning. So you focus on that, but then the normies come and then they leave Farkaster then? No, so this is actually, you know, and I have to kind of fight with the early users, because when I say that, they're like, well, why do I want to use this if normies show up and then I don't want to use it anymore? And the difference between something like Farkaster with Twitter or Facebook is you can build your own client or fork the experience. And so the example I always give is you can provably show that you were in the first 10,000 users of Farkaster and someone could go build a client that only allows the original 10,000 people to show up in the network so you can preserve the glory days of the network when it was small, but it's completely interoperable with everybody else in the network. And I inevitably think, and this goes back to the idea of the separate clients, is people aren't just one dimensional, right? So we're already starting to see now that we have a concentration of users, the conversation probably was 90 to 95% Web3 and crypto a year ago, whereas now I would say it's 50%. And people are talking about the NFL, that was on Sunday, or whatever news event that's happening. And so I inevitably think as you add more people to the network, people will actually start to use multiple different apps that all port into the same identity and actually represents much more of what you are as a human, right? It's like you might have a work self, you have a home self, you have the sports fan self, whatever hobby you're into, and then I actually think those affinity groups actually start to become separate social networks. And I think there's a good analog here that Twitter's never been able to breach from two different social networks. The first is Reddit, so subreddits are infinitely more interesting on Reddit than the main feed on Reddit. The main feed on Reddit doesn't get nearly as much interest as the people as they go into the topical areas of Reddit. And then Facebook groups, right? So Facebook is a self, is kind of this dying, decaying product, but Facebook groups is actually pretty thriving. And so you kind of realize that as these social networks get larger, you actually need to allow people to kind of split into their various different tribes. And I think that the beauty with Farcaster is you don't have to beg the core team to build a product that caters to that, you just can go build your own client. Right, so the idea is because the identity is public, and basically you can create filters for any arbitrary client based on number of tweets, type of engagement, when they joined, whatever. Yeah, I mean it's like, you can get really complex with this stuff, because I have a long-term belief that most credentials or anything that's interesting will end up on chain, right? So the Midas list from Forbes is going to be less interesting than the equivalent that is a ranking of provable, you know, ZK knowledge proof of returns on chain, that you can actually now build an experience to say, I want the top thousand VCs in the country to be able to access this app, and when your returns aren't good enough, you get kicked out of the app, and that's all just happening with the blockchain. How do you think about the core user behaviors that people exhibit on these networks today, and do you expect those behaviors to change in any way in a centralized versus decentralized setting? Yeah, so today we don't have any financial incentives in the network, and so the behaviors is actually very similar to a Web 2 social network, it's just a kind of group of curious early adopter folks who are finding like-minded people on the internet and kind of talking. The behaviors we have are much more akin to Twitter, where it's just kind of this public performance, right? So if you kind of think about Facebook, there's a reasonable expectation of privacy, you're focused on who you know. LinkedIn is kind of this quasi who you know, maybe you met someone at a conference, but I think Twitter generally is, you're actually broadcasting to an undefined number of people, and the expectation is anytime you put something out on something like Twitter, anyone could find it. So I think that there's a little bit of that performative. I do think as the network continues to grow, going back to this idea that there are going to be many different clients, I think you're going to have changing user behavior in that inevitably as the network gets larger, the realm of speech for people of what's acceptable gets tighter. I think this happens with every social network, where in the early days people are a little bit more loose and casual, and then as it gets larger, you have a larger audience, you're kind of pretty careful of what you say. But I think that the ability to have many different types of clients actually hopefully keeps some of that really, I think, meaningful user behavior, where people are a lot more earnest and willing to talk. And I think that the other thing that we're hoping, because this is all built in a kind of open source backend way, and it's crypto, is the idea of zero knowledge proofs, which you probably have heard a little bit about today, it's a pretty cutting edge area of research, but it actually starts to enable some really interesting use cases, and the one I always bring up for folks that know American history is a founding component of our Constitution is the Federalist Papers, which were three, James Madison, John Jay, and Alexander Hamilton, they wrote under a pseudonym in a New York newspaper with the pseudonym Publius. And so I actually think you are going to start to see ways of basically creating these group pseudonym accounts that you can actually prove with credentials to say, okay, the three people behind this account all have a, I don't know, net worth of X or education credential of Y, and people are actually, who understand the math, are going to say, yeah, that's valid, the zero knowledge proof there works out, but that actually enables a new type of speech, and to me, with any new social network that works, you actually have a new unit of speech or a new kind of vector of how you can express yourself that actually goes viral. So, you know, example of Facebook is you're connecting with friends you know, and then you have the news feed, which they develop, Twitter is this kind of broadcast to an undefined number of people in a feed, Instagram, obviously, is a photo in a feed, and then Snapchat is the disappearing, TikTok is kind of the algorithmic, and so what I'm hoping is because you actually have the open back end, we, unlike most other social networks, don't actually have to at the beginning nail some new social primitive, what we're actually trying to say is we're going to start with something that's well known, this kind of intellectual space for Twitter, and build the set of kind of open tools that other people can actually go and build on top of. Now, that's not useful unless you have users, so I think that that's like generally our priority is if we can't invent the new social primitive, if I could, I would, the next best thing is get as many people actively using our client, which effectively increases the total addressable number of people in the protocol that makes it attractive for another developer to come in and say I have this crazy idea, and I know there are 100,000 active people on Farcaster, maybe if I go build my social network there versus trying to bootstrap from the start, it becomes an attractive platform for people to build on. You just kind of alluded to the fact that there's no financialization today in Farcaster. If you introduce financialization into things, you get weird incentives, obviously civil attacks, those kinds of things. There's been lots of examples of people in the early social experiments with crypto, 2016 with Steam, with Stepin more recently with Wax Earn and the Play Earn, and we've seen this, that when you introduce these financial primitives, it changes the behaviors. So have you thought at all about do you introduce financial primitives, what kinds of behaviors do you want to encourage or discourage? So how do you think about that in the context of creating content? Yeah, so I've been in crypto for a while, but I think that adding any type of...

# Building Social Graphs as Protocols, Not Companies [fW9-dEOSX8A]_part2

of financialization, you should have a very clear understanding of what happens once you're at it, because it's going to magnify whatever behavior, right? And so I think the thing we don't know with Forecaster is, if you go out of financial incentive, like what is immediately the kind of bad behavior that could end up happening that kind of kills the network? And so I think it's been a slower process, but because we've been so deliberate about not having anything like that, the people who are actually using the product today are genuinely using the product because they find it useful and the community interesting, and that is actually starting to compound in a way that we're pretty happy with, as well as the developers, right? And so for us, the focus on making the app useful is the primary benefit. Now, as we think about the kind of future, I actually think one thing that we are very pro is this idea of composability, right? And so the ability for people to permissionlessly start to add financial incentives or tie things in, whether it's with NFTs or DeFi, that's totally fine, and I actually think it should be encouraged, and it shouldn't just be at the kind of client level, just dictating how monetization or something else would happen. And as a result of that, I think we can actually focus on building the primitives that actually make the social network useful, and a lot of the other financialization can maybe be indirect. That said, I do think at some point, like, if the protocol itself, which we actually plan to charge a subscription for, if you effectively want a premium account, you're not paying the company, you're paying the protocol. And so I think that the analog here is, if you've ever used Twitter, an account has a blue check. It's a pretty arbitrary reason Twitter gives people blue checks. In our view is, if you pay the protocol, you should just get, ours are purple, but, like, you get a purple check, as a base-level kind of status distinction. And it actually has a thing within the community that, okay, well, if you're serious about using Forecaster, of course you're going to pay the protocol, because it's kind of showing that you're committed to actually the long-term longevity of it, and you actually start to generate revenue with the protocol, and then I think you can actually figure out the right set of financialization of what behaviors you want to encourage, and then also potentially encouraging developers to build the apps and clients that we think should exist. Yeah, one thing I observed is Signal now has this where you can pay, I think, 5, 10, 20 bucks a month, and you get a little badge. Telegram added this as well recently. Twitter added this. It feels like an underexplored vector for all of social. Well, I also think that, you know, again, it's maybe a generational thing, but I think people dismiss cosmetic upgrades that actually don't mean a lot, right? It's easy to say that they're stupid, but a game like Fortnite or Counter-Strike primarily monetizes through cosmetic skins. It does not make you a better player. It just looks cool, and I think, you know, there's a lot of analogs in the real world. It's like, why does someone have a watch if they have a phone? I don't know. They think it looks cool, and that goes pretty far, especially if you have people spending a lot of time in something, right? Yeah, the amount of time people spend on social, it's very rational to spend 3, 5, 10 bucks a month on a lot of these things, not for all of the users, but maybe 1, 3, 4, 5% of the users, something like that. Okay, so you just talked about people paying in Farcaster to the protocol. This kind of naturally leads to, in the long run, where do you think the equilibrium is between revenue generated by the protocol versus revenue generated by clients? Do you have a strong opinion? How do you think about the problem? Yeah, so I think it's hard to model. My bias, and this is probably showing, like, you know, I kind of grew up in crypto at Coinbase, is I think that there's a lot of value that ends up occurring to clients, because I grew, or kind of model, attention is where the value is. Again, you can monetize attention in a variety of different ways. And I think the fat protocol thesis, for those who kind of know what that is, is I kind of disagree with that in the case of social, because I think the hard work is actually in capturing people's attention, and people don't use protocols, they use apps. Apps can be built on protocols, but I think that the attention is where a lot of the value is. That said, I think that one of the reasons RSS lost to Twitter is RSS itself, for those who don't know, it's kind of this real simple syndication, you can subscribe to blogs. Actually, all of your podcasts get distributed by this protocol still, but it was run by one cranky guy, and he got in a fight with a whole bunch of open source developers, and never made any progress since 2010. But there was no financial mechanism to actually continue to develop the protocol. And I think when you kind of look at, you know, the kind of like Corel, OneChain, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, like there's actually incentive because the actual chains can generate money. And so I actually really, this kind of like subscription to the protocol is actually a mechanic that we're gonna test, but we hope that if it works, it actually creates a very sustainable revenue source for the protocol, so that the protocol, regardless of any given client, can actually continue moving ahead. Another good example of this is email, right? Email is probably one of the most used apps on the internet today, maybe the most used app. And there's no one who's incentivized to really move it forward. And if anything, it's actually at this point controlled by Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. And I don't know if any of you have ever tried to boot up a new domain, like a.xyz domain. You can't get it delivered. It's such a pain to do that. I tried this a couple years ago with this Helm email server thing, and it completely flopped. Right, and so people don't talk about that. It's just like actually, it's not even, you know, open source anymore. It's just controlled by three big companies, and they get to decide the rules for how email works. But if you had actually a sustainable model, and obviously it's pre-crypto, it could actually be very different. And arguably, email would have also done messaging as an open standard rather than WhatsApp capturing that value or something else. Okay, I think last question, and then maybe we have some Q&A. What are some of the interesting things being built on top of Farcaster today? You highlighted SearchCaster a few minutes ago. Anything else that you wanna highlight? Yeah, so just another simple one is, for those who are familiar with a website, Hacker News, which is just a kind of series of links. It's run by Y Combinator. It's very popular with developers. Someone just built that on top of Farcaster. But what's interesting is, if you actually just think about it, a lot of people in a Twitter feed are sharing links, right? And each time a link is shared, that's kind of like a vote. And so what someone did is they just took the data set, again, permissionlessly, and was able to just display it in a way that just looks very similar to something like Hacker News. And what's interesting is you can't do this on Twitter today because Twitter wouldn't give you access to the full fire hose and probably would shut you down at some point. And people find it extremely useful. And this is a product that it took a developer a weekend to kind of put together. And so it's a great example that I actually think there's just gonna be a lot more of these experiments, and maybe some of these end up turning into the kernels for really large businesses. But the thing that I'm most excited about, that we just recently launched in our own client, and a lot of this is informed by TikTok, is so I actually personally hate algorithmic feeds. I'm like a reverse chronological. I wanna follow who I follow, and I want it in the exact, like an email inbox. But the reveal preference for most users in social is they want TikTok, right? And if you actually look at all the major social networks, they're all moving towards an algorithmic feed like TikTok, where the concept of following someone doesn't matter nearly as much as just if you spend time on that, they're gonna show you stuff like that again. And so I'm actually really interested, given that the data set for Forecaster is open, is actually allowing the kind of like world of data scientists on the internet to actually start developing their own algorithms, and then allowing you to subscribe to different people's algorithms within our client. And so it effectively creates a marketplace for the best algorithm. I view that as it's actually a really easy way for people to test out an interesting idea, and if it ends up working and their algorithm gets a lot of views, again, going back to this idea that we need to be a steward for both the protocol and our own business, is we're not gonna immediately just clone that algorithm. What I'd like to do is actually figure out a way, can you actually subscribe to that algorithm or create effectively a monetization model so that other developers in the ecosystem that are providing value actually can build meaningful businesses, which I think further brings developers in the ecosystem and then ultimately more users. ♪♪♪

# Dan Romero： Farcaster, building a decentralized social network [eGafcKj_Qac]_part1

Hey everyone, this is Zeno with another episode of Into the Bytecode. Today I sat down with Dan Romero, one of the co-founders of Farcaster. Farcaster is a decentralized social network. It's being developed as an open protocol that is credibly neutral like email and can grow to support many clients and products built on top of it over time. I personally deeply resonate with the level of thought and intentionality that Dan and team are putting into developing this protocol and really do think it has a chance at becoming foundational infrastructure and making a meaningful difference in the world. This was an interesting conversation and I had some personal light bulb moments through it. For instance, talking about how small product decisions in these social networks have ripple effects in society and how there's a deep path dependency in how things evolve. How Farcaster really has to win over users in one of the most ruthless arenas for competition in the world today, which is competing with other social networks that have had years to mature and thousands of engineers working on them. And we talked about their strategy for doing this, which I find to be quite brilliant. We also got into some of Dan's personal philosophies around how he's building the team and why they're bringing together a small lean group of senior engineers and intentionally not building a large team. With that said, I'll leave you to it and I hope you enjoy the conversation. One of the things I was actually personally very curious about was when you left Coinbase, I know that you spent some time really kind of zooming out. I think in our first conversation, you told me a bit of the political science, like history, kind of like deep dive that you did in that interim period. And I'm curious how that period was for you and then how you were thinking about what to work on next and why you chose this as the thing. I've been at Coinbase for five years. I left May 1st of 2019 with an explicit goal of taking a full year off. I wanted to get bored. That was advice. I talked to a bunch of different people. How do you spend your sabbatical after working in a company for a while? And so I think I was generally pretty successful in doing that. I think COVID kind of made it a little less fun for maybe the second half, but for the first part, traveled. My wife was off as well, so it was the two of us. It took a kind of wide aperture in terms of the type of stuff that I wanted to be exposing myself to, especially on the history side. And one thing is like when I was traveling different countries, I tried to read a history about that country and a little bit more understanding of the world. So we started our trip in the Middle East. I read this incredibly dense book on the history of the Arab people and some 1200 pages or something like that. And I think it was just exposing myself to a variety of new kind of ideas and just new information. And I think it was a bit of also a kind of decompression from five years in crypto and Silicon Valley. Right. And I think a little bit of time and space away from the day to day grind left my mind a little bored and a little bit more creative in terms of like, okay, what do I want to work on next? I have had this idea for building Twitter as a protocol and a lot of people have had this idea, but there's an influential essay that Paul Graham wrote in 2009 and it's on his website. So if you go to paulgram.com slash twitter.html, it's one of his shortest essays. And he makes this really interesting observation that Twitter is a protocol that somehow ended up within a company. And you could maybe say that for other companies, but specifically Twitter, if you kind of think of email as this decentralized protocol where I can specify the recipients and then they reasonably will receive that email. Yeah, you have spam filtering and email deliverability, but for the most part, it's kind of this one to a defined number. And then the web is this kind of, I can put information up there, but then people have to kind of find it and discover it. And then Twitter is this kind of hybrid where I can put a thought out and it's not specified to the number of people from my end, but other people have specified that they want to actually receive that information. And so the actual kind of original name for what Farcaster was, was RSS plus because RSS in some ways has a very similar aspect to that where it's, I can tell you which, which blogs I want to get updates from. And then you do this kind of pull model. But the thing that's beautiful about Twitter is, is a vertically integrated experience. And so the feed discovery, the kind of easy navigation of the UI that you can kind of follow rabbit holes and click through usernames, find profiles, get all their content all in this kind of really nice, slick app experience. I think that has always kind of intrigued me as like, well, could you actually build that level of UX polish, but also have the backend be truly decentralized. And, and part of that is also, I, I, my first kind of forays into building apps was building on top of the Twitter API. So I was an early Twitter user in college and I built a polling app. And so I think the idea that Twitter could function as a protocol, those first five, six years where the, the API was much more open and you had all these third-party clients, we actually have a counterfactual, like it was a pretty exciting time. There was a lot of innovation that happened. And then reasonably the company needed a way to monetize. They didn't want this fragmented ecosystem. And so they kind of put a cap on what you could do in the third party and, and kind of start working through their, their primary client and which I could show ads and things like that. So that idea had been kind of rattling around in my head. And I think with a fresh set of eyes on like how to potentially go build it, started to kind of formulate this, this general idea of what if you made Twitter similar to something like Keybase, which for those who might not know what Keybase is, is kind of this nerdy cryptography startup that ended up selling to Zoom. But it is a really interesting idea where you could associate your other identities online, your, your Twitter, your GitHub, your Reddit with a cryptographic proof. And then not that every user would need necessarily verify this, but you, you had the option if you were technical to actually verify that the, the proof that the person's Twitter was, you know, DWR on Twitter, it did actually kind of compute. And so thinking that maybe you could do this and actually use a blockchain as that kind of public key to identity pairing, and then everything else could actually just magically happen off chain. And then that way you could kind of like bring the whole system together so that you got the kind of best aspects of web two, right? Speed, usability, no cost to do anything with this kind of sovereignty that you could get by actually having stuff on chain. That I think is the thing that clicked while I was traveling and a little bit bored to the point where I started spending more time thinking about the IDMAs around that, did an exploration of like, how could you just improve RSS? Feels like RSS is actually pretty old school at this point, even though all podcasts, this podcast is going to be distributed via RSS. And I think that the summation of things, plus I reconnected with a colleague of mine from Coinbase, Viren Srinivasan, who also seemed kind of interested in working on this. And we actually just then started working on prototypes because I think that there's benefit, especially if you don't have other kind of like, we were self-funding it, like just action produces information. So we've said like, let's actually try to get a prototype working that simple system where we put the stuff on chain, testnet, and actually get everything else working off chain with a client. And that initial system ended up turning into what is now Farcaster. Yeah. It's pretty wild how simple the primitives involved in Twitter and now Farcaster can be and how like the kind of emergent things that they can lead to, like at a base level, it's really kind of like RSS, like you're saying, right? You're publishing something and other people on the other side can say that they're interested in hearing it. Was it through this process of kind of starting to work with Viroon and prototyping things, was it clear to you that this was the idea that you're going to go after? I'm also asking, knowing that you have a very long-term kind of point of view on this, right? I've heard you say elsewhere that you're going to grow to the first million users, compounding 5% a week or a week or a month, but in either case, it's going to take multiple years just to get to that level. So you're obviously at this point committed to working on this for a long time to come. How did that happen for you? Yeah. It's good to kind of step back. And I think one of the other things, having left Coinbase, I kind of had this thing in the back of my mind that Coinbase would go public and there was going to be a decent economic outcome there. And that the thing that I wanted to work on next was going to have a long time horizon. Elon is very inspirational in that sense. I think the level of his work ethic is something that I was never going to be able to go reach. But I do think that there is something that all people who can kind of look at that and say, okay, I have a long time preference here, can work on something that's really ambitious and know that it potentially takes a long time to get there. And so kind of going into it, I didn't want to build a company that I was going to work on for three years and then sell to Coinbase or Google or something like that. I really wanted to work on something that I could see myself working on for 10 or 20 years and building a credibly neutral public square for the internet as a protocol, which is the best way to describe Twitter, seems pretty reasonable to potentially work on for 10 or 20 years, especially given I think a lot of the consternation that now exists with centralized social media and kind of, it brought several billion people online and connected them. So I think to me, that's actually net positive, like as much as people want to say social media is net negative. But I do think that there are a lot of challenges when one company owns the entire stack as opposed to something like the web or email, where I think that there's a lot more competition. And we could talk through any of those models, but I think in terms of what I wanted to be working on is saying, okay, what will I be proud of 10, 20 years later, if it works, it's a big F. I think internet scale protocol that you could sit alongside TCP, IP, HTTP, SMTP, DNS, and then forecaster potentially as that, this is the social graph protocol that's credibly neutral like Ethereum and like all of this kind of stuff that lives in the crypto world. But now trying to kind of blend it because much of forecaster is off chain, right? It's much more of a traditional web protocol. I think that that's motivating and allows us also to make decisions that are oriented towards the long-term versus trying to hit some arbitrary number in a compressed period of time. So the invite model where we want to be consistently growing, but not growing too fast has downsides in the sense that maybe something else pops up that grows a lot faster and ends up getting people to use it, could happen. But I think our point of view is quality is underrated and in a kind of culture that puts a lot of emphasis on doing things extremely fast. And I think that there's benefits to speed and kind of urgency, but in terms of building a social network, especially given that there are web to social networks at scale that already exist, we're not dealing with a land grab scenario. We are dealing with the next best alternative is actually a really mature polished product where people already have existing audiences. So I think taking a different tack of saying, okay, we're going to actually double down on quality is something that's a lot harder for an at-scale network to do because they're already dealing with the issues of quality when you're at scale is extremely difficult. Yeah. It's very interesting. And I think there's a deeper kind of meta point here, which I sometimes think about in the context of building anything new or anything new in crypto, which is, you know, if we're really building these long lasting protocols that are meant to be woven into the fabric of the internet and the world and outlast our lives, like they really, like they need to be built on solid foundations. But then on the other side, a lot of kind of discovering what crypto is able to do comes from running these experiments without any kind of like thinking about like, how's this going to evolve? Like you can't really see around these corners in some ways. This is actually one of the things I've really resonated with how you're building Farkaster, which is, it seems like you're being very kind of methodical about separating out the pieces that need to be robust and reliable and then being like, okay, there's this, you know, there's a way we can experiment with having, you know, there can be different hub clients or there can be different algorithms for sorting this stuff and there can be different applications, but they can plug into something that is going to be robust and sustainable. And I think that's a very interesting thing to think about as we're building these protocols. One frame we have is if you start from the goal of what we're trying to build, this is an internet scale protocol that's credibly neutral that anyone can use to build a new social network, right? That's the end stake goal. In order to get there, in order to meet that bar, you need many different apps and services, clients, open source projects built on top of the protocol. That requires developers and developers to put a lot of effort and energy into building that set of, you know, apps and services. You're not going to get that just from a technical specification. So what is actually going to attract the developers? You need a baseline set of competent technical decisions, but the primary thing that developers who are building, at least in social, they're looking for daily active users. Like that's the liquidity, right? If DeFi is TVL, like DAO, daily active users, is the TVL equivalent for a social protocol. And daily active users don't use protocols, they use apps. And so from our point of view, the only way we're going to even have a shot at bootstrapping this ecosystem, and it's unclear if it'll work, right? Like we're going to do our best and try to take a long-term view, but you have to get an engaged, high-quality group of people using a single app every day to generate at least the initial amount of data that actually at a protocol level from the kind of data and APIs that you can access, starts to become interesting enough that other people want to start to experiment, right? And as a result of that, if you're trying to do everything in this kind of decentralized, permissionless, like ship it and then do governance votes, your rate of innovation is just going to be a lot slower. And I think that you need to just have a pragmatic point of view as saying, here's what our goal is, here are the things that we've done so far to actually make it decentralized. And actually decentralized, the four primitives is a really important thing for people to start to trust you. But part of that is also just, it's a narrative and a belief in that team that, do I trust that these guys are going to do what they say they're going to do? And a lot of that is earned through actions, right? And I think examples here also, we have this initial client, but we're not trying to go gobble up every interesting idea that's happening in the ecosystem because it potentially drives more usage in our client. We actually need to be protocol stewards with this. And so for us, it's this kind of balance, which is not a web two model, right? Web two is all about bringing that stuff in house so you can better monetize. And it's not a pure protocol model because we actually have an opinionated point of view, having built this initial client, both on what the protocol should actually be doing as a result of running it for a year and realizing all the shortcomings that happen to the technical side of the protocol. But also we have daily active users and when they're not liking something, we need to actually make changes to our client that then we need to think through, hey, is there a way to actually make this default or this set of decisions we've made? Can we just actually codify that in at the protocol level so that another developer, when they're showing up, they don't even have to run into the same issue. It just kind of works in a way that they might not even realize, but that's actually been optimized at our client level. And we figured out the set of trade-offs to make it the protocol level to make it easier for other people to build clients. And I think that is the thing we're going to run into a bunch of pushback in terms of the architectural decisions we've made for Farcaster. And I think that, hey, it's healthy, right? Free market. Like if you have a better idea, go build. And if people use it, that's all that matters. But I think what we've realized a year in is that the protocol should be in service to new developers, right? So then the marginal developer who's showing up, you should try to make the protocol as easy as possible for that developer to boot up a new app service client and actually be on a level playing field relative to the incumbents or the people who got there first. And so you can make decisions on how much storage there should be for a hub required or how many we think is reasonable for decentralization, right? You could get to a model where if you have five, is that decentralized? Some people would say yes, but from our point of view, we actually want many different clients and experiences. So as a result, we want to actually make those hubs be excellent from a developer experience standpoint and reasonable to run for anyone who wants to be able to play around with it. And we have to deal with those trade-offs versus other networks might be able to actually exceed our ability to do certain things, but then they're going to have other trade-offs, right? Like they might be more on chain. So there's actually gas costs that comes as a result of using it, or they will be less centralized or less decentralized because the requirement to run a hub is higher. Yeah. The relationship between the product and the protocol is a very interesting one. How are you thinking about the product long-term? Are you, do you see it as a core, like you're going to build it into a compelling application that people use in the future, or is it more for the sake of fleshing out the protocol in some sense? And both sides of this can have kind of good reasons for them, right? There's Uniswap for instance, where the front end app is still one of the best ways to interface with the protocol, but then just in the last couple of days, there's like nouns, you know, disbanding their Discord because they don't want to have this like original thing that was somehow well-positioned to begin with. So I'm curious, how do you think about that question? I think Uniswap is a great example of this. If Uniswap didn't have uniswap.org, would it be as successful as it is? No. I think most people would say no. And so as a result of that, I think where we stand is having a really high quality client.

# Dan Romero： Farcaster, building a decentralized social network [eGafcKj_Qac]_part2

that has the compounding, assuming we have competent product, thinking, design, you know, UX, if we compound that client over three, four, five years, that just becomes that much better for onboarding people into this overall ecosystem. Now, the thing that we are going to have to earn trust of is that going back to this idea that we're not grabbing the best features from the ecosystem and trying to keep people, you can kind of view us, uh, an imperfect analogy, but we're like the New York city, Ellis Island of Forecaster. Right. And so you show up plenty of people who immigrated to the United States when Ellis Island exists, lived in New York. And it's the reason that's the largest city in the country today. But there are also a lot of people who moved to other places and they got to make new decisions and, and they belong to the protocol that is the United States. Right. And so I think that that is much more of our role and we need to kind of realize the things that we're going to be good at. And yeah, actually keeping focused and not expanding the scope of that app over, over time is probably the right call. And I think one thing that's really inspirational as a company like WhatsApp, whereas if you actually look at what the original WhatsApp was versus where we are today, yeah, there have been incremental product features, but the core of what WhatsApp does is more or less the same. And, and, and they were known for being like a relentlessly focused culture of like, we're going to just be insanely reliable at doing messaging. And I think that that's a lot of the product ethos that we want to bring to our own client, again, separate from the protocol. And I think as in, in doing so we can actually help onboard more, more users to Forecaster than, you know, anyone else, at least for a while. And as a result, I think that that benefits the protocol, right? Cause every daily active user of our client becomes an addressable daily active user for another developer building on top of Forecaster. And in, in kind of viewing it like that, we have to kind of go again, earn our right, our, our, our reputation as being a steward and we're like, wow, they, they really mean it when they say every user that they onboard is an addressable user for me as an app developer, even if I'm building a competing client. And I fully expect if Forecaster is successful, right. Talk at a hundred plus million people using it, billion plus people using it. We will not have 90% market share. Like if we do it, like, I don't think we're going to have 90% market share. A, I don't think we would get to that scale. Right. B, um, it hasn't succeeded as a protocol. Exactly. So, so people can trust me or not. It's like, I have a long time preference on this. I really, really care about the protocol succeeding. And I think I'm just going to have to repeat that message for years on end. And at a certain point, some people will trust me and other people will, will not, and that's fine. And so like, I think we have to do that through actions. And if we, if we successfully do that and we can, can, you know, every time we do it, it actually starts to compound our reputation as like, no, no, they really do seem interested in the protocol. This is not all big, one big rug. That like, sorry, corporate APIs, like we now run the protocol, which I actually think if you, if you look at the protocol and we actually achieve the, the, the trade-offs that we're, we're claiming to make with kind of our architecture. You don't even have to trust me because you, you actually are running a hub that has access to all the same data that we are. And, and so I think that that that's the challenge over the next couple of years for us to solve. And I think the early community believes in what we're doing and what we're saying, but to get it to a much larger scale is just going to require a lot of continual decisions that we make that people start to trust that like, Hey, this is actually a protocol that I'm willing to go spend time building a business on knowing that it's going to be a credibly neutral, stable foundation. Totally. And I totally agree with you that the application compounding over time is the best gateway for onboarding new people. Like I've even found with myself, like when you added the algorithmic feed, that was just a huge game changer for me. Cause it was starting to get to the point where it was just chaos in there and I couldn't follow what was happening. And it just takes time to build a compelling product experience. Yeah. That's a great example where I think we were really hesitant to have an algorithm early on partially because the way I like to use Twitter is reverse chronological, but you do using it for 15 plus years. Yeah. You know, well up until recently I only followed a hundred people on Twitter. And so for me, I'm a completionist. I would actually go through and try to get back to the part of the timeline that I had left off at. Like it was like that, that's how I wanted to use it. I grew up reading RSS, right? Like that, that's how an RSS reader works. I think more recently I've been trying to follow more people within the crypto world, especially people who are already on Forecaster, because it's actually a good signal when people DM me to get on the network, which is currently the way you get into the beta, I can actually see mutuals. So if a hundred plus people that I'm following across this pretty wide swath of people in the crypto world, then I have a pretty good sense of like, okay, you're probably someone who's going to, you know, people are going to find interesting on Forecaster. And so I've actually seen a lot more of the algo with Twitter. And there are definitely some parts that I'm like, wow, this is actually pretty good, like I'm getting a lot more discovery, but then you have the threads and some of the things that kind of take advantage of the algo. And so I think one of the things we were really sensitive on is should we add an algo because that's actually also where a lot of people get frustrated. It's like, well, okay, what is the algorithm rewarding? And I think we got comfortable about a year in adding a very lightweight one. We call it highlights. And you, you, you know, you're actually there. It's like the default feed is following. And then if you tap into highlights, you're kind of opting into seeing this. And one thing that we've emphasized in highlights compared to maybe something like Twitter is that the primary way that we kind of bring conversations up in this algorithm is active conversations. And, and it's, it's not the kind of like one banger, we call them casts, but like tweet that that is like a dunk or a quote that has a lot harder of a time getting into that algo, whereas if you get something that actually has depth, if you think of the conversation as a tree, that you have all these kinds of interesting things happening, that that's, that's factoring into the algorithm a lot more. And what's important is because this is the default client that most people are using, that is actually nudging the behavior and norms of the network towards a more conversational platform. And I think that this is one thing that abstractly I kind of understood, but now that we're seeing it is the product decisions we make in this initial client. Have a huge impact on the shape and behavior of the network and the protocol generally, especially in this kind of constraint environment where we are doing a lot of the, on, we were doing, we're the only way to onboard right now. And so I think one of the beliefs we have is if we, we keep it invite only for somewhere close to a million, right. It might be a little less, might be a little bit more. And we moved to a model where people in the network are actually doing the inviting rather than everything kind of coming through me. I think that those defaults are really important because whereas right now you onboard with me kind of like in this chat and, and I can kind of reach back out to you if something, Hey, like that doesn't really, and it's like, I actually spoke with this person. I can't just go and be a total asshole on the other side of this. It's like being invited to a dinner party, a dinner party with 4,000 people. It's like, you do feel a little bit less like, okay, I should be a little bit more civil. But inevitably people are going to invite people. They're not going to have any other context. They're going to show up in the network and they're going to behave the way they want to behave. And so actually having solved for those defaults, that reward kind of call it constructive conversation. And I don't think we've, we've figured that out completely, but if you can actually do that by iterating while the network is small, then I think as you scale the average experience for a new user, as well as kind of power users still oriented towards quality, because you, you've kind of made the set of defaults in the interface oriented towards what you want people to do rather than what an algorithm might. So I think that that's how we've thought about it. And we're not perfect. Like we're going to make mistakes, but I think part of the perk of like, I use the app a lot, is if things aren't going well, like I'm going to get a pretty quick sense of that and then we can make the decision that like how to change it. And so I think if we were just working on the protocol and then we had other developers or the ones building clients, it's way harder to convince people to convince someone, like you have to do a lot more influencing and you can criticize that and you can say, well, okay, so then it's just basically, you're making the decisions of who gets onto the network. You have the client and you have the protocol. But I think going back to this idea of earning the trust of developers, which we have an early group of developers who have been building on top of Forecaster, despite, I think an okay dev experience. But, but the idea is that they're realizing that the community is really high quality. The data and APIs are actually open and they're seeing me say on a consistent basis, no, no, no, like we're, we're actively trying to figure out ways to actually support other developers building. And like, these are the trade-offs that we're making. I I'm optimistic that we can actually get to a place where we have a competing client in the next year that has a reasonable level of UX, because that's, that's the other thing there's the theoretical decentralization where, oh, well you could go build your own client if you want, but like if we kick you off our client, you effectively are kicked off the network. So I think that there's a practical level of decentralization and practical bar. That is a much higher threshold than theoretic. Like, yeah, sure. Go write your own client. Like no one, no one's going to do that. They're just gonna go back to Twitter. Whereas if there were two legit clients above a certain baseline of UX, then I actually think you have something interesting. For sure. And, and the cra the crazy thing is this is making me realize what I had missed, which I do think about sometimes, which is I've been focused on the protocol and the protocol is what matters, but the client is actually, you know, yes, there is a, the, the design and the architecture of the protocol will deeply influence the things that emerge out of this over the next 10, 20, 50 years. But really it's the client, the early client and the decisions around small product tweaks, like the shape of the algorithmic feeds, the, what you prioritize, the people who see the community, these things are designing the kind of social layer of this entire kind of wave. Right. And in some ways, I mean, the, the crazy like planning for the success case, right, if this thing actually does grow to be used by billions of people, like these decisions that you're making today could have ripple effects into the shape of society in the future. The same way that, you know, Facebook and Instagram and TikTok, like this product decisions that they make ripple through, like, you know, just how, how people feel and think on a personal level, how societies relate to each other. And that's the super fucking crazy thing about, about what you're doing. Yeah, I think it's well said actually biology, uh, casted yesterday after being off for a little while, he came back and he made an observation where Farcaster is effectively community first, not technology first. And I would quibble a little bit to say that we've actually had to make some interesting technology choices informed by usage, but I do think that there is some truth to that in that you can make all the right protocol choices, like perfectly designed protocol thought through everything, like beautifully written software, but if you can't actually bootstrap the initial community, which is a little harder than people just choose to use the technically best thing. They don't, they, they choose to use the thing that is most interesting. And the thing that makes it most interesting most of the time is other people, right? And so I think the story of like, how did we get from, you know, 10 people using it every day to over a thousand, I don't have like a perfect, you know, we thought through this and we knew it was going to happen. It was a bit of onboard a bunch of people, have a bunch of people turn, continue to make week over week progress. People refer other people because it's kind of interesting. And at a certain point you hit a conversational liquidity point that the network, I can open up the app and there's always something new and interesting, assuming you're following a sufficient number of people. And so we're now at a level of, I actually think we have something where people are referring people to Farcaster. You should check out Farcaster, not because of the product decisions and the technology. It's the people. It's the people. So that becomes another question is like, well, okay, how are you actually going to compete against something like Twitter? Right. It's like 200, 300 million people who are using it every day. And we have a thousand plus, but what I would actually say is you've got to break that problem down differently, so something like Twitter is actually call it 95, 98% entertainment and news for people who use it. And then a very small subset who are these kind of like very online public figure type, very much into tech or crypto who actually use this as this like weird public chat room social network, right? Like my, my parents use Twitter, but they don't tweet. Whereas, you know, I, I I'm having conversations with strangers all the time, and I think that's completely normal, so there's actually a very small percentage of people who use Twitter as a social network. So right away, you can actually go from, oh, this is a network of two or 300 million people using it every day. How could you compete with them too? There are several million people who use it as a social network every day. So that, that becomes a more achievable number if you think about it. And then if you actually say we're only going to focus on one community to start, which is what we have, and it's, let's just focus on the people who might on the margin, and I don't even think this is a primary driver, might be finding that this is a decentralized protocol, ideologically kind of interesting, some NFT features, none of those are game changers, but I think it, if you, if you focus in on that, what, what is the actual size of crypto Twitter? 100,000 daily actives, maybe less. So now, if you, if you actually say it's well, if I have a thousand people using the app every single day, and there are a hundred thousand people in my addressable market that at least trying to go after, I think it's a pretty good that at least trying to go after I'm 1% of the way there. So that like that, that like changes the game in terms of like, okay. And, and actually think we've been even more specific. I'm not even trying to win all crypto people. Like I love Bitcoin. I own Bitcoin. I, I don't think Bitcoiners are going to want to use anything that has to do anything with Ethereum. Maybe at some point, if it's interesting, fine. So what I'm actually focused on as Ethereum people and people who maybe are like, you know, in a different ecosystem, but don't necessarily hate Ethereum, I think even smaller number. And so like, that's the goal. It's just like, just focus on people who are building an intellectually curious and Ethereum, make that the best social network for those people. And, and permissionless innovation and the nice integrations. And then from there, see if you can actually convince another concentric circle of people and, and kind of work your way out. And so I think that that has been informative in the sense that we don't have to work on like virality and all of these things that I think people just take for granted with social networks. And if anything, it's actually much more akin to how Facebook, which if you look at any social network, it is by far the largest, even if it is kind of declining in DAU and what did they do? They started at one college and then they expanded to another set of colleges, all, all kind of permission-based. And then eventually they expanded to everyone with a.edu email address. You can think of that as like.eth, but it was invite only in the sense that you had to have a credential to access Facebook for multiple years. So the most successful social network in all of web two was invite only for two years, and then people are saying the way to grow a social network is to grow as fast as possible with virality. It's like, ah, maybe there's a lesson there. And then that cohort, the university students turn out to be a very interesting cohort that's getting older and other people want to be around them, which could also be potentially said about the current cohort of like Ethereum, crypto, Twitter, like this group is going to become way more influential and nerd snipe the rest of the world potentially. Yeah. That's, that's the belief. Like, so for me, it's, it's.eth and.edu are the equivalent and it's like start your seed, your social network with the optimistic, the people who are curious building the future in eth. And I actually think that that, that is a, that is an interesting group of people to go on a journey to see if you can build a incredibly neutral decentralized social network. In the very least. Yeah. And, and, and maybe, maybe it never achieves that scale, but we're gonna, we're gonna try to do it. This is, it's actually, it's, it's, it's easy to not like there's, there's like real kind of strategic brilliance here. I feel of like, not to, not to, not to compliment you too much, but yeah. Carving down this problem of how do you compete with these incredibly mature social networks that are, it's basically the most ruthless like arena of competition in the world. Right? Like the way TikTok and Instagram are competing, like it's insane. And to carve that down into, we don't need to get everyone like size it down to the.eth people and then design the protocol I imagine would, I mean, some of the protocol features are probably being prioritized because they unlock certain abilities of the product layer, but the protocol is going to be what it's going to be, but the product showing NFTs and like these sorts of things. And the community you're seeding it with. So it's not only like a, you know, target user who we're going after, but it's also like the product features that you're working on is all designed around getting this initial cohort. I feel that's super fascinating. Yeah. Look, I we'll see if we can do it. I think that there are credible other projects out there that maybe their strategy ends up appealing more to these, these types of folks. So that that's like one way. One other thing is the stated preferences. We want this, but the reveal preferences, I like having a million followers on Twitter and I'm not really at risk of getting de-platformed so it doesn't matter and I think that that's also pretty reasonable from the individual's perspective, I'm optimistic that if you focus on quality and try to just make the average conversation on Farcaster is one of the highest quality places that anyone is talking about anything, crypto or web 3.0, I think that's a good three and I don't even think we're there yet. I think we have quality, but I think it can get even better if that can happen. Then I actually think you can attract a very interesting group of people to be using at least a client. Hopefully ours at least to start every day, which then developers all of a sudden say, this is actually a really interesting audience to go build an app for because not only, not only are they interesting people within a community that you bootstrap the other side of the marketplace too, because these are people who are early adopters, who have money to spend, who have like, you know, creativity to lean into new use cases. With, with also the primitive of, you know, every user on Farcaster has to have a public and private key, which as a primitive by itself is really powerful. Right. Like I think it's one of the reasons people are so excited about building an Ethereum is like when you can identify every user by a public and private key, all of these zero knowledge use cases start to pop up. It moves from the realm of theoretical because you've solved the, the like cold start problem of, well, how do you get public and private key infrastructure for every individual? It's like, turns out it's like some of the financial speculation that I think has driven cryptocurrency adoption has built out a huge ecosystem that you can now play around with some of these ideas that if you go back to the web of trust, GPG, PGP, like all of that stuff, that was always kind of this dream. And it goes back to this idea of a key base. I think very noble in what they, what they're doing.

# Dan Romero： Farcaster, building a decentralized social network [eGafcKj_Qac]_part3

we're pursuing, one of the most like mind bending products to think about, like if they had actually been successful at hitting some amount of escape velocity, I think you can kind of walk through the idea, as I say, maybe it will never be a consumer use case, but the idea of actually getting everyone to be identified by a public and private key, let alone a cryptocurrency address, just simply a public and private key, I think unlocks a completely different set of experiences that you as a developer can build. And it fundamentally would change the way humans communicate, right? So one easy example, and then encrypted experiences get way easier to manage if you can make some assumptions. Whereas basically the only at scale and encrypted, you have signal, and then you have WhatsApp. And the only reason they did it is kind of one of the co-founders was really passionate about implementing it, which is an amazing achievement. But basically everything else is kind of like done in this surveillance state infrastructure, which is kind of wild if you think about it, especially in a place like the US where we have very strong protections around freedom of speech and privacy. And because we just decided that as a society, reasonable individual choices that convenience trumps kind of some of these core tenants, now basically all of our communication belongs to a bunch of big companies that- It's insane. You have no reasonable expectation of privacy with. And I think if you spend more and more time online, like you should be able to use experiences that aren't clunky, but also give you your kind of like constitutional rights in a variety of different ways. Yeah, it's hard because there's a path dependency to how it develops, right? And the trade-offs that each individual makes at their own level of, I don't wanna use this app that's like hard to use, gonna take like five seconds to load, all that stuff. I mean, even me with Farcaster, like I haven't actually, like I'm just kind of, I'm in the cohort of users who's like converting finally, I feel. And for sure with this conversation. But so the user makes the choice of, I wanna use this thing that's easy to use. And then the net effect of that compounded on itself for five years is that the entire world is using Facebook. And all of our data can be read by Facebook and yeah. And here's the thing, you can either get mad at that or you can just, it's basically a law of human psychology. People are gonna use what's convenient and easy. Like they love free, that's why ad models work. And so you can get mad at that, or you can say, how can I build something competitive with that so that the user looks at it and goes, oh, this feels basically the same. But could potentially have a very different set of underlying principles that again, might not even matter to that user, but they're using it because it's solving a problem or it's providing some utility to them. But all that stuff underneath the hood is abstracted away, but has enabled a whole bunch of other use cases because it's fundamentally built on a protocol and you have these public and private keys that you can actually use as a developer to create new experiences. I think that is what I'm excited about. If we do hit some amount of scale, in many ways it's actually very similar to what Apple does, at least from their marketing standpoint is, and to their credit, I think a lot of their decisions are actually privacy enhancing in a good way. But then it's like, oh, well, we need to increase revenue. So let's build an advertising business and kill everyone else's advertising business. And you asked me not to track, but the Apple can track me unless you go shut it off in this esoteric menu. Right. So it's like, okay, so fine. I don't really have many alternatives, but you can imagine a world where that becomes the kind of base level is norms are around kind of privacy encryption. And then people can compete with that being like a core primitive of what you can do rather than maybe a corporate marketing strategy, which they changed. Like, I feel like the gravitational pull of the other or the existing model is so strong, both from a, you're an entrepreneur, developer, you're building something or from the user's point of view and like the ripple effects that these things have in the shape of the world and society over time. And what's crazy to me is one, how it comes down to nuanced product decisions and like concrete execution right now, and like onboarding these users and getting something that works. Like Keybase didn't work because of slight things about their model. It's not enough if you believe this is a better world, you have to actually like out execute the other people who are running downhill. And because the other way is easier, it also requires a founding team and early people who are working on it, who actually hold these beliefs truly, right? And are principled about it because the other, like there's just so many off ramps where you can sacrifice them in some way. And this is the same thing that I've always admired about Vitalik, for example, right? Like Ethereum has like the staunch, like, no, we're building this decentralized infrastructure that could be like a protocol that much of the world taps into in the future. You can't be kind of optimizing for short-term wins or personal financial gain, even though like those things will also happen naturally as a by-product. But it's almost wild how I feel like if you ran multiple, you know, simulations of the world, like if there was a Monte Carlo simulation of the world, like the world where something like this actually exists and takes hold is maybe a rare one. But then once it does like get past a certain point, it's like so strong and robust because it's gonna suck in all the liquidity. It's gonna be something everyone trusts, like can't be rugged. It's very interesting in that way. And I feel like, I mean, just even thinking about that, I feel like in the journey of Farcaster, there will probably be this inflection point, right? Where it switches to, okay, now this is the credibly neutral, you know, communications protocol of the web. And if it succeeds and then it starts just like out competing everyone else much, much more easily. So two things there, one, I think Ethereum and Vitalik are deeply influential on how Varun and I think about this. And there's a reason we're using Ethereum L1, despite people saying, oh, the gas costs are this or that. I think for the identity primitive that makes Forecaster work outside of what's off chain, we couldn't think of a better network to go put it on. And I actually think optimizing for cheaper transactions per second or any of that stuff is, especially if your architecture actually doesn't need most of the stuff on chain, you only need to do it once, what better chain to go put it on because it's actually capturing a lot of how we approach things as this pragmatic approach to building, but also a deep philosophical belief in decentralization. And I know there are plenty of people who wanna criticize Ethereum for not being decentralized, not gonna convince those people. But I think for us, building on that infrastructure, like that's the same thing that we wanna achieve for our own protocol is that we want people to deeply believe that they're doing this because they actually want this to hit a level of scale and credible neutrality, similar to Ethereum. The thing is, is like, will it work or not? I'm not sure, but we control our own destiny in the sense that we don't have to rely on anyone else. We don't have to convince anyone else other than the users to use the protocol because we've built our own client. And if we can continue to grow the number of people who wanna show up every day, have conversations, even if it's just one client, we do that for two or three years, and then people start to get interested in building on top of it because we've hit some sufficient number of people building. I think that's totally fine. Like, I think that's a reasonable path and people might criticize, oh, well, you didn't really have a thriving protocol until then. But I think what matters is, does the protocol have actual people using it? And like, do I actually wanna build a product or service that go after those people? I think that's it. And so I think just take the time preference of saying, like, this is what I wanna go do and be willing to realize that it's gonna take a long time. You know, easier said than done, but I think for what we were optimizing for, going back to working on a problem for a really long time and having a clear goal of like, where we wanna head this, right? Like, there is no version of selling this to Facebook or Coinbase or whatever. It's the protocol should outlast any company if it is successful. And so I think one analogy here is when the internet happened in the 90s, AOL in the US was this huge platform in terms of getting people online, but AOL in the early days didn't have support for the internet. The internet was purely an academic thing. And then Mosaic came out and then people had other providers that would provide access to the internet. And then eventually AOL added the support from instead of just having this closed network, you could actually go use the open network. And I think that the point you bring up of there will be an inflection point if it's successful, where because the amount of kind of innovation that's starting to happen on this open ecosystem and the kind of ability for anyone to go build a business and not have to worry about gatekeepers over here, I do think has a shot of happening, but I would suspect that it's going to be a while. And I think having the mentality that you just know it, it's like, all right, there's probably another year or another two years or three years before that happens, helps you manage through the cycles of the ups and downs because you don't expect it to happen tomorrow. And it's not gonna be like this sudden, magic inflection point as much as it kind of flips. And then that in itself starts to be a compounding curve. And so if you actually just think through, whether it's an S curve or like exponential growth, you realize these things go for a very long time where they're small, if it's actually on a curve and it's just hard to know where you are on that curve. Right, right. One of the things I was gonna ask about is in relation to competition. So we talked about, yeah, how strategically you're competing with these existing social networks, but I'm curious more as an operator and the person who's doing this, right? From a personal, like emotional point of view, how do you think about the notion of competition? How do you relate to it? And I imagine like one of the things I was kind of trying to put myself in your shoes was seeing all of this stuff happen with Elon Musk and Twitter, right? Who is like one of the most formidable, like the most formidable entrepreneur of our time has bought this company. I think it's going through, is like letting go of 75% of the people supposedly. So it's a new kind of like force that's entering this dynamic that has a lot of moving parts already. And part of what I've taken away from what you've said, which resonates with me too, is if you're really just focused on your own, if you really believe in what you're doing and you have a long-term point of view and you're in control of your own destiny in some ways, right, you can just kind of shut all of that out. But I'm curious just also you having been someone who's, you know, was at Coinbase through all these years and just as a person who's doing this right now, how do you think about these things and what can you share about that? So I think I learned a few things at Coinbase. One, and I think people don't appreciate this from the web two element because Coinbase is very much a Silicon Valley company and, you know, big in the sense that it has a lot of users. Coinbase doesn't have a network effect. Coinbase is a brand, a brand that people trust. There's convenience. There's, you know, a lot of features, you know, payment methods, all the countries that it serves. But you can buy the same Ether, Bitcoin at a competitor and probably for a cheaper fee. And so for the 10 plus years, people have been saying, oh, Coinbase fee compression. The only thing Coinbase has done is double prices. Like in 2016, it went from 1% to 2%. And everyone said, oh, you're gonna have all this fee compression. And you might even look at their public financials and say, oh, look, the average fee is going down. It's actually just because the institutional volume is increasing and so that's cheaper. And so it's a mixed thing. Prices probably come down over time, but fundamentally Coinbase actually is much more akin to what at least initially drove a lot of what people picked Apple for in the sense that they, there was a brand, it was kind of a set of decisions. If you did every feature, you know, the classic example is the iPod compared to some other MP3 player. If you're just strictly doing it on storage functionality, it's something better. But I think Ben Thompson's talked quite a bit about this of like the thing that a lot of the kind of analysts when they do everything data-driven miss is taste and consumer preference. And the idea that like people like things that they can resonate with. And I wouldn't actually say Coinbase has that level of love that compared to something like Apple. But I think actually what people underrate is most people who get into crypto don't wanna have a hardware wallet. They don't wanna use a controlled wallet. They actually just want something that feels safe. And the reality is that for a lot of people, Coinbase just is super easy and it makes them feel safe. And the company has taken security really seriously. And I think that that's paid off for them. So shifting over to kind of thinking about that for Forecaster, the reality is I think the network effect, A, if the protocol is successful, it's actually you've commoditized the network effect. You've said the network kind of is a neutral ground and anyone can kind of tap into it. And so as we think about building our client, our client is very much, assuming we actually follow through and don't do things that are adding features that create kind of lock-in. But I think the reality for our client is it's always going to be based on do consumers or if we do a subscription model, do our subscribers, do they find value in this client? Like, are we adding the features that people actually want and providing some amount of value to them to actually use it every day? Otherwise they're gonna switch to something that's better, right? And so I think that that's like a mentality that a lot of web-to-marketplace companies or with network effects think that they have, but the reality is they can get very far off of just taking the same kind of network effect with proprietary liquidity and run for a really long time. The one I love to point out is Airbnb. Amazing design product is I think generally really great and stand at plenty of Airbnbs. But the fact that people complain about this cleaning fee and they have made this decision, AB testing or conversion rate that, no, we're gonna hide the cleaning fee until the end. If there was a real, I think marketplace out there of like, assume Airbnb was a protocol. That as a client, I don't think would cut it. And so they're able to kind of exist on the fact that the way that that model is structured and they did a lot of hard work to build that proprietary liquidity, but it isn't a protocol mindset. And so I think that that's like one thing that is from Coinbase that we very much resonate with is that we're only as good as like, what's the last feature we shipped or what value are we providing to our customers? I think the second thing on competitors, and this is a little bit more of a philosophical point, but I very much believe in Paul Graham's philosophy and it's a little crude, but you're more likely to die as a startup from suicide, not homicide. And I think it's a little bit of a Hollywood version of startups where you're in the arena competing with others and it's like the competitor launches a product and you got to follow and that's how people think. And I think that the reality is all people think that their competitors are out executing them or they're perfectly polished when the reality is if you know anything about a startup, they're pretty chaotic inside. And I think that if you spend too much time worrying about competitors versus just if you have users, like what are your users want? And a really simple example of this is every so often on Forecaster, I just say product annoyances, like go at it, like tell me all the things that you can't stand about the client. And if I was worried about like what competitors are launching, I could like go build a product strategy based on like trying to compete there versus just asking that simple question and getting a hundred responses. And then you kind of realize like, oh shit, like there's a lot of stuff that we can just improve with our own thing, let alone any new features. I think that is a lot more of the type of thinking that people should be orienting towards. It's interesting talking about that on Forecaster is like the extreme version of tell people about your idea, they're not gonna steal it, they're gonna give you good feedback, but you're literally posting it publicly for all potential competitors to come and see the list of your deficiencies and what they can do and all of that. Yeah, if you're not intellectually honest with that and you can't actually even let your competitors look at it, I think it's gonna be very hard for you to win, especially with software, right? Like other industries might have slightly different models, but the industry I know is like internet software. And I think that the kind of like, look, all our metrics are public, all our competitors, like in the web two sense or web three sense, their metrics are public, web two, they're public. So you get a sense. So in some ways, it's like everyone kind of knows all the dirty laundry that exists. And the thing I think you're like, instead of spending time on your competitors, I think what you should actually be focused on is, again, another Paul Graham, build something people want. And so for us, it was, and another thing he said, is you're gonna find a hundred people who love your product then a thousand people or 10,000 people like it. So much wisdom in that. Yeah, I think like any entrepreneur who is building something new, Paul Graham is like, that's the zero to one Bible in my view, because it helps you get the right mindset. And a lot of them sound trite, but the reality is I think that they are the correct points of view, hard to follow. Because sometimes when you're going through a day to day of the emotional rollercoaster that can, you know, it's like, okay, I don't need any more trite advice from Paul Graham, but if you actually step back and remove some of the emotion from it, it's probably right. And I think the miss is people tend to think that like doing a startup is like this kind of like strategy chess thing that you're thinking about competitors and where to kind of, that is much more at the one to 10 or frankly, 10 to a hundred scale that now you have like big, big groups of people and it's like, okay, where do you direct them? Whereas as an early stage startup, it's just, you wanna be as close to the metal as possible, which is what are your users saying? How are they feeling? And so it's, you know, talk to users, find people who absolutely love the product, double down on what seems to be working there. Hopefully you don't end up at a local maximum, but like overall your competitors are not gonna be the way to kind of like find the unlock. It's actually in your community of users. And so I think people overrated. They also don't know what they're doing and you've got as good of an intuition or better one with the users that you have and what they love. Yeah, I would actually say it's, you start worrying about your competitors, you're starting to let them drive your product roadmap, which if you have good intuition, now you're actually imported someone else's intuition, which you don't know if that's actually good or not. And yeah, there can be some growth numbers that look exciting, but if you're not confident even enough, like the point, like why did you even start working on the...

# Dan Romero： Farcaster, building a decentralized social network [eGafcKj_Qac]_part4

thing in the first place, if basically what you're doing is looking at another thing and saying, oh, well, they're doing this, we should do this too. Now, asterisk, sometimes someone actually unlocks fundamentally something new, and it's probably useful to know what other people are doing. But outside of a rare instance, I don't actually think, and in that case, even if you try to go copy it, it's unlikely if someone gets this breakthrough thing, product, strategy, whatever, that somehow you're going to copy it and then out execute them on the thing that they already have the insight. And so I think, you know, call it whatever percentage of time people spend thinking about competitors, it probably should be a 10th of the time, if not, you know, even lower. And then that extra time can go back to thinking about your community, your users, your product, your protocol. Totally. And, and then the, the kind of mirror to this question is with this mindset of everything's open, we're going to talk about things openly. It relies on an ability, like in a, in a knowledge that you can execute and you can, you can move really fast and you can, you can actually like ship the things you're going to do. And on this point, you're actively hiring kind of like staff, you know, engineers and you're keeping the team very lean and this is, you know, this is not what everyone does. There's people who just go hire like 50 people immediately as soon as they raise money. So how do you think about the team architecture and how that reflects into how you're operating and building what you're building? So Varun and I both worked at Coinbase. I was employee 20 and you know, I think Varun was around play 50. We saw a thousand plus people get hired. And I can tell you from my experience is when we were a thousand people, I don't think we were moving any faster than we were when we were 50 and I think there's a variety of reasons for that, but, but fundamentally adding more people adds more complexity to doing anything with a group. That's why I think generally great things are achieved with much smaller groups of people, like in terms of like great creative output, because managing a large group of people, you know, the, the top of the pyramid talking down to the bottom, it just kind of doesn't work. And so I think where we're approaching this from is we still have a lot of stuff to figure out both at the protocol level, but also the product level. And having a large organization means I'm outsourcing a lot of those decisions to people who have been, you know, they might be smart, but they just have been working and thinking less about this problem than I have. And I think that like, you, you can tell like Forecaster, like it's very deliberate in the sense it's like every decision that we've made in the app was made by me, but also by Varun and the team's input, right? Like there, there it's, it's actually multiple people at the same time. Multiple people who have kind of like really put an imprint on it versus I think in a larger organization, you end up getting a lot of individuals make decisions and then it kind of like filters up. And I think that the other general point of view is I think most companies just hire people because that's what other companies do. It's not a first principles approach. So example, Instagram got to 27 million users, I think more or less with 13 people in 2012, arguably one of the most successful products of ever. If not, you know, any type of software network period. I mean, it's basically where all Facebook's value comes from today, like in terms of the growth and like monetization. And so that happened in 2012 and we're in 2022 and you're not saying 10 years of developer productivity, like with all of these cloud services and tools and, and, you know, improvements that you can't go build a social app with that many users with that few people and, and, and the other example is I think WhatsApp and there was a viral tweet today, JD Ross, who's the co-founder of Royal had it, Elon responded to this by the way, so he, he brought up the fact that WhatsApp had 35 engineers with 450 million users, that's more than Twitter. And so Twitter has 7,000 plus people today. They're talking about doing a 75% reduction. Look, anyone losing their job, like that sucks. Like you, you know, you've got bills to pay, et cetera. But just if you take the abstract of going from 7,000 people to 2,000 people and WhatsApp again, almost a decade ago was at 450 million people with potentially way higher daily active usage in terms of what you're kind of sending around. That that's, that's an insane ratio. And I think the last point specifically out of crypto Coinbase got up to 6,000 people last year, FTX is 200, maybe, maybe a little higher, roughly the same trading volume and yeah, there's other things like Coinbase has a hundred million consumers and like, there's a lot more there in the U S there's regular. But I can promise you that if one has 200 and you have 6,000 and you're doing roughly the same volume, the one that has 6,000 has too many people. And so I think just if you, if you approach it like that, you, you should be really, really hesitant to add headcount if you don't need it, because what you're doing is you're, you're decreasing the ability for your organization to move fast because you're adding overhead and some businesses are going to need that. Right? Like if you have an operations heavy business, like a business like DoorDash or like, yeah, of course you're going to need to do that. But in a case of building a protocol, like if you actually build it correctly and then you have this client that's on top of it, you should be able to get a lot of leverage and scale with software and these tools and the, the, the other examples I'll give you is I don't think Uniswap was that many people for all the volume that's gone through Uniswap and then, and then OpenSea even, right? Like, yeah, OpenSea last year had to end up hiring a lot of people, very similar to Coinbase in 2017, but they hired a bunch of people and now volumes have come back down. So in some ways, like in hindsight, 2020, you might not have hired as many people because they, I think they had to do a layout. So it's this, you, if you, if you think about the systems that you want to design upfront, you have senior people who actually know how to build those systems rather than build a system that works today and then has to be replaced two or three times along the way. I think you can get a lot of leverage with a really small team. Yeah. And frankly, it's just more fun, right? Like Jeff Bezos has this concept, two pizza teams. Like there's, there's kind of like a fun aspect of like, we, we had the team on site, everyone's remote a couple of weeks ago and we had a night where we just played out a board game, terraforming Mars. There are only six of us or, you know, and so it, like, that's pretty magical when the group of people that's working on something that hopefully ends up being a scale, can sit around a table and play board game and, you know, have two pizzas. And so I think like for us, like getting much bigger in this early stage where we don't know if we've actually figured it out, it's just, you're, you're cargo-culting Google, which is what I think most startup things in Silicon Valley look at Google, which is the best business model of all time. And they go, oh, well, we should offer these perks and we should do this and that and that, and it's like, yeah, well, if you have a search engine that kicks off a hundred billion dollars a year, I would offer these things too. And have all these, you know, moonshots and venture firms and all this other kinds of stuff. Whereas the reality is most businesses aren't like that. So maybe it'd be a little bit more judicious in hiring. And does that, does that flip at some point? Like when you get it to a particular scale, does the mindset shift? I mean, I could, I could see it also not if FTX is an example, and I don't see from first principles reasoning why you need to get to like thousands of people. Hey, look, like I grew up on the operations and BD side at Coinbase. I don't have any interest in hiring a BD person. I have very good friends who are, you know, business development people. Like, I don't, I don't see it adding a ton of value. I know people talk a lot about BD and like crypto and like telling you it really like users don't really care. So that's like a whole function you don't need. Yeah. I think you can be really smart about finance, like in terms of just like building out, you know, I think one other thing that we've done is like most of our stuff is off chain. So we don't need to deal with all these like money transmitter licenses and all the other stuff that's something like Coinbase. So, so being deliberate in terms of what you're doing on the technical side of things can actually flow through with the shape of your organization. But, but yeah, look, if you had 10 million daily active users, like you need, you need an operations team to help with the customer support side of things. Believe me, I felt that at Coinbase, public failures of not scaling customer support fast enough. Right. I think you, you're going to need the ability to handle like a DMCA notice. And it's like, yeah, it's a decentralized network, but your client actually is a company. So you need to comply, like all of that stuff happens, but doesn't happen for a while, and I think part of where we need to focus is not building like the infrastructure for a thing that might happen, it's actually make that thing happen, and if you're a little bit more experienced and get a little lucky, you can kind of start to sense that that's the trajectory is actually happening. And then you can actually start to hire those people in. And I think I'm fortunate in the sense that I had to do that on the fly. Coinbase, and there were a lot of failures associated with that, but I think if that we were fortunate enough to have that happen again, I think I would be able to kind of execute on that a lot better. Cause I had already done it. And it's a, it's a, it's in some ways a better problem to have than a bloated team that's ahead of the problems it's trying to solve to like get hit in the face with like a ton of work and everyone just has to like do work 24 hours a day. Until you can catch up. Yeah, I think, uh, another interesting thing that I associate with these headcount numbers is it's pre COVID Silicon Valley culture where people really don't talk about revenue and metrics. Like it's kind of this, this thing where you, that it's weird. People will talk about how much they raise and have the valuation. Cause that now became public thing used to not be. And now people don't talk about revenue or profitability or metrics while they're a private company. So the proxy to measure your progress is to tell the startup parties what your most recent round was. So it's like, Oh, look at these fancy investors telling me that it's worth this on paper. And then how many people, how many, Oh yeah, we're a hundred now. Like, Oh, that sounds impressive compared to a two or three person startup. What I think is more interesting is like, no, no, we're, we're 12. Yeah. We have got 10 million active users. Like that, that, that's a lot. Yeah, the active users, like that, that you don't hear that, right? Like you hear plenty of companies that are a hundred people. So I think, I think it's just a norm thing. And I think Silicon Valley late stage zero interest rate policy, money is cheap. Like that was the culture. Yeah. It's interesting that, you know, these are people who the role should have self-selected for people with conviction, with an ability to think, you know, outside of the herd mentality and these sorts of things still happen. One other question that came up, cause I'm very curious to hear how you think is remote. Why are you building the team remote? And how do you think about that? So there's a practical reason and then the philosophical reason. So the practical reason is I'm in LA. My, we moved down here to LA from SF after 10 years there during COVID, my wife got a job at SpaceX, liked it. So we're going to stay. And my co-founder Varun moved down. So the two of us are actually here. We work in the office every day, sitting next to each other. It's like a garage. And we could do the model where we actually say, Hey, you need to move and co-locate. But I think the reality is LA, despite being a large city, and there are definitely talented engineers here. The pool of senior engineers in LA is going to be way smaller. Then somewhere like the Bay area. So we could either move back to the Bay area or we can say, Hey, let's, let's build remote. And I think that the thing that works for remote in my view is if you hire senior people, they, by definition need less management. Like they're more experienced. Like if you say, Hey, we're trying to accomplish X week over week, they're actually good enough to push back up front. Like, Hey, that's too much work for this week. And you actually can trust that judgment. And then assuming you kind of scope something correctly, you can give them that work and they need minimal input. You know, there's instances where you're brainstorming, but they get the work done week over week. I think a more junior person and junior people are my favorite people to work with in the sense that they just tend to have a lot more energy. They're earlier in their career. They're hungry to learn. That's not to say more experienced people don't have it, but on the average. Those people actually, I think need to be in office. And my view is I think you learn a lot by kind of osmosis being around people. And like I went through that experience for the first time. Years of my career where, you know, in an office, like being around other people. And so I think that if we do start hiring more junior people, we're going to have a very kind of focused in office culture here in LA, because I think that that will be the best way for those people to get. Maximum amount of learning and also their effort, which they tend to be very high energy, high effort. Can kind of be channeled in the right way to get the most efficiency out of. And so that's our general approach is we're going to hire remote for senior and then for and engineers and designers. Like I don't think operations people generally should be remote. Like I think they should be in person. Like I grew up on that side of the business. So and then I think that the last point is, and we may change this over time, but we're pretty strongly in favor of keeping the time zones to North America. We're here on the West Coast. Our view is like plus three minus three, which there's really not much minus three. Hawaii, I think would qualify, but that's it. That's all we do. Because even if people tell you that they can work those hours, it's really inconvenient when it's three o'clock in LA and you ping your colleague in New York. And they say they're working those hours, but the reality is their kids are home from school. Like now they want to be having dinner and the two o'clock or three o'clock people on in the West Coast, they're like, hey, like we want to actually get this resolved now. And so I think getting farther outside that just gets that much more challenging. And so I think we're willing to compromise with like East Coast to West Coast, but not much else. Yeah. Awesome, man. Well, I know we're coming to the end. So I thought we would close with more of a fun question, which I think will still be instructive for me, which is, this actually came to mind reading some of Varun's casts, where he recently did this AMA and someone said, Varun is the dark horse comedian of Farcaster. And he said that you basically force him to do five Joe casts a day as an engagement metric. And the question there is maybe related to that, but prompted by that, which is if you're talking with someone who's thoughtful, has things they're thinking about in their head, but is not effective at using Farcaster or Twitter or like social media in general, what are the things you tell that person, whether it's Varun or me or anyone else? Yeah. So to clarify, that is a joke from Varun. I do not require. He's actually a pretty funny guy. I think the... It would be a good like KPI, like dashboard. Look, I think naturally, people have asked me this, oh, you should just hire a community manager and have them do the community stuff. And that way you can free your time up. And I view that as like antithetical. I'm trying to build a social network. Like if I'm not the most active user or close to one of the most active users, then clearly we're doing something wrong. So you kind of need to actually teach people how to use social media. Actually teach this to the people who work at Farcaster. Like it's part of what they need to do. Well, what I would say is it's interesting because I'm deeply introverted. I like to say like I'm an introvert or like I'm an extrovert, but I only play it on TV or I only play it on Farcaster. It's you can ask my wife. I'm like very much an introvert. I need my own time to kind of recharge. But I think that that is actually a natural tendency. And a lot of the people we've onboarded to Farcaster, they fall into two camps because they kind of tend to be more technical and it's Ethereum builder types. There's the extroverted type, which they get it right away. And then the introverted type is like, I don't feel comfortable or it's not perfect. And I think one people are just, you have to just get over that of like, just kind of put it out there and don't take yourself too seriously. And if you're in an app or environment where you can actually say something and then people kind of give you the benefit of the doubt or nuance, I actually think is more reinforcing to want to do that. I think what's challenging is if you're trained to Twitter, you kind of realize if you have a bad take, like you just could be descended on with like the quote tweet and then like all these other people who want to hate on it. So I think that that's one thing that people just, when they start to try to use Forecaster, like, whoa, like I got like actually quality engagement and not engagement and likes, but in terms of like people actually responded to the question. It's actually, that's one thing I say to everyone is, one thing that Forecaster does really well right now, while it's still small and hopefully we can talk about it more, and continue to try to scale this, is if you ask a question, you're going to get, I think, generally pretty good responses. And I think part of that is like the size of the community, but it's also just generally people are craving this ability to actually have like a conversation versus, I think sometimes with something like Twitter, given how mature and at scale it is, people view that very much as kind of this broadcast platform that's where you do your shilling and all that kind of stuff. I think that the second thing is, and I try to do this myself, is like, I think memes are like a pretty good icebreaker in the sense that you can either take it from somewhere else, which is the Elon strategy, right? He doesn't make his own memes. He gets them from his meme dealer. But I actually try to make memes on a regular basis. I think it's like people talk about Sudoku being good for your brain or, you know, word puzzles. But like, I actually think it's like communicating with an image template that the same thing that you would want to say in text is a little bit more amusing, right? To see SpongeBob doing it with Squidward is more interesting than me writing the same thing. So you have something you want to say, and instead of trying to like craft it into a short form written thing, you're like, I have this to say, how do I put it into a meme? Yeah, and actually there's even more compression there, right? Because what you're importing is the point of the meme, which requires a little bit more intellectual engagement from people, but they actually probably find it fun, especially if it's kind of funny. And then you can actually put the actual message and you're writing some text still. But I think that that like is another interesting way because I think there are certain people who are so good at Twitter. Like they know exactly how to like put everything in. And it's like, you're like, I can never be this funny. But I actually always say to people is using a meme template, like you're basically getting someone else's creative output and then you're just putting a thin layer on top of it. And you actually look, there are some accounts on Twitter that are very good at Twitter, like Turner Novak, VC, not really into crypto. He's extremely good at seeing kind of like what's happening in the meme-osphere and then like bringing it in for the like tech Twitter take of the day. And like, I think that's brilliant. And it's like, I actually think more people can do that because it's like, they have an observation they wanna make, but by kind of doing it with a meme, it also kind of de-escalates a bit. Whereas like you have this profound statement as like a tweet or a cast. It feels like you're doing this versus if you kind of like my feeling when.

# Dan Romero： Farcaster, building a decentralized social network [eGafcKj_Qac]_part5

like I see this in Ethereum and then you have like SpongeBob. I can still make the point, but it kind of by definition is like a little bit more cheeky. So that would be my other piece of advice. Yeah. They're actually a deeply textured format. Like there's a lot of depth to them because conveying something with humor and irony and like not saying what you're exactly saying, but saying it between the lines. Like there's, it's a pretty, you know, deep. And the fact that it's like so funny and doesn't take itself so seriously only makes it more interesting. So you might call that Straussian or something where like you can actually communicate multiple messages to multiple groups with plausible deniability, which I think that's actually important. Right. Be like, Whoa, I put a picture of SpongeBob up. Don't take that as a treatise. Right. So. Yeah. Awesome, man. Well, I think let's close here. This was a lot of fun. Thanks for having me.

# Decentralized Social Networks with Dan Romero and Nick Tomaino [U2b35wbfabI]_part1

Hey, how's it going? Good to see you. How are you? Good to see you. Cool. So many of you guys know that Dan and I work together at Coinbase. I always said when we worked together that I thought Dan would be one of the most successful people post Coinbase. And then when he learned that he was building a product that really resonated with me and I started using it and loved it was kind of a no brainer for us to invest. Dan, why don't we start. What was your biggest lesson from Coinbase that kind of has helped you navigate Farcaster and really, you know, you base your building Farcaster on, if anything? The one thing that Coinbase did really well and I learned there and continues to do well today is a sense of pragmatism in a space that is, or can be pretty ideological. You know, when we were working back at Coinbase in 2014, we were Bitcoin only. And I think there's kind of a very hardcore culture within Bitcoin of, you know, not your keys, not your coins and Coinbase is evil. And it's kind of disheartening if you spend too much time like reading Twitter or things like that, or talking to like hardcore crypto people to have them be kind of saying what you're doing isn't real crypto or, you know, is in kind of antithesis to the core values of the community. And then kind of over the five years I was there, you know, we onboarded 100 plus million people into crypto and the kind of primary on ramp for most people getting into crypto for the first time. And then you kind of quickly realize that it's easy to be ideological and have opinions on Twitter. It's extremely difficult to build an at scale financial services company that follows the regulatory regime, right? And the stuff that FTX was doing, while at the same time still actually providing kind of fundamentally new technology and kind of innovation. So I think something I deeply respect about Brian's ability to kind of like continue on the kind of like path towards this being this mission driven company of like building in crypto and not getting distracted with things like blockchain. But at the same time, realizing, hey, we, we need to follow the regulations like this isn't kind of like Uber or Airbnb where, you know, a local taxi regulator or kind of housing authority can kind of give you a slap in the wrist like you get on the wrong side of Treasury or the DOJ you go to jail. And I think that that balance of kind of wanting to move forward while at the same time knowing what rules that are like kind of non negotiable and also just relative to the ideology in the space, and just like the fundamental UX and and pragmatism like building an app that people can use. I think that that is very much internalized for me as I've approached Forecaster. Yeah, I like to call it the intersection of purists and tourists I talked about it a little bit early but you know the purists are the you know the Bitcoin maxis or the kind of deep ideologues and the tourists are, you know, you could debate about who exactly is who maybe, you know, FTX, Solana, things like that and I think really kind of want to be at the intersection right and that's obviously, you know what you're trying to do at Forecaster. So, decentralized social has kind of become a big narrative in the last year or two, right, and there's a lot of, you know, new products popping up. Forecaster is one of them. One of the unique things about your approach is you've kept Forecaster gated for the past year, really year plus I think. And that's at a time when you know you have all these people that want to leave Twitter. There's more and more talk about, you know, decentralized social so why, you know, take that approach of keeping it gated versus kind of trying to capitalize on the, the interest in decentralized social. Yeah, so two, two ways to think about it. So the first is we started working on this in 2020, when I originally remember telling some of the people who were kind of interested in what I was working on next. And people kind of looked at me, being like that's kind of complete waste of your time like what are you, what are you thinking. You're going to get kicked off Twitter like it was just kind of like the only people who need an alternative to Twitter are kind of like this deplorable set of kind of political folks and like, you know, what are you even spending your time, you're just going to get a parlor gap. That's what you're going to do. Fast forward to, you know, Trump getting kicked off which, again, I think most people on the left side of the political spectrum and like okay that seems reasonable to then Elon acquiring Twitter and then quickly the same people going wait a second like we shouldn't have one individual controlling a social network like this. I think things have gotten. It's like trendy to say oh like look, you know protocol based social networks or decentralized social networks. It's their moment right mass it on and all these other things. Our opinion, going back to the fact that we were predating this trend is the best social network in history in terms of total daily active users it's Facebook still growing they just think I think hit like 3 billion daily active users or something. They were gated for two and a half years, you could not sign up on Facebook if you wanted. You could get a.edu email address which is some version of kind of quality gating for the first two and a half years. And so, if it worked for Facebook, why wouldn't it work for a new social network and I think that there's this kind of mean that happened in the last, I like to call it a zero interest rate phenomenon plus the the S curve for mobile is social networks grow virally and just kind of you have this explosive growth overnight and it's kind of an overnight success, whereas I think most important things and things that last just are kind of like slow but but consistent compounding. And so that that was that was our original strategy and so when when things changed in the fall and people saying hey like this is the moment for decentralized social wiring you opening up the floodgates. The, the second framework that we kind of applied to that to say okay should we revisit this this core tenant of our strategy of keeping things gated and just kind of consistent compounding and growth is the, the framework of stated versus revealed preference, which has been pretty brutal in terms of building a product in the space of my initial set of people that I went after for Forecaster, we're all my kind of like crypto friends who've been talking about the need for decentralized social and talking a big game on Twitter about how we needed this. And so we go and build the first version. I on board them over zoom. They are kind of excited about it and then they use it for that day and then they don't come back, and I think that's the stated preference on Twitter is that they care about the stuff the reveal preferences, they have, you know, 500,000 followers on Twitter and they've spent 10 years building that audience. They're not going to give that away tomorrow. So even if they kind of like want to talk about the merits of decentralization, using a new decentralized product, even if it's if it's halfway decent is not actually optimizing for the thing that the reveal preferences is what they care about is is reaching audience. And so, my, our thought is that this data versus reveal preference. This is not going to change right now, like so if you if you're complaining about Twitter, for whatever reason, and you're saying you're going to mass it on, if you've seen the data, like, you know, in the fall people were saying you're crazy why aren't you opening it up, mass it on I think it had a 60% correction in there. By the way, they're calling monthly active users which is not how Facebook measures their social network daily active users is the actual liquidity of a social network, and no one wants to serve daily active users because daily activities is a really really hard number to grow. And those numbers are down. And so the stated preferences Twitter sucks I'm leaving Twitter, you announce it on Twitter, by the way, you don't say that on Macedon, and then you go use Macedon for a few weeks and then you come back to Twitter and so I think we're back at the same place where there are no shortcuts to building something that's valuable. And I think, in our view, I would rather focus on what I would call forecaster natives people who don't already have a lot of accrued social capital on Twitter, but are willing to do the proof of work into a new social network, where they're they're contributing to the conversation liquidity and things like that. And I think that's the foundation that we want to be able to grow from. And so far that that strategies worked out pretty well, right, it took us a really really long time to hit what I would think of as like that kind of first order of magnitude of conversation liquidity where you open up the app. So the app is like Twitter, and there would be new posts, other than for me. And so once we hit that point, what was interesting is the secondary effect of that is now people started to want to tinker with the permissionless APS. And so that that kind of back and forth is the thing that we're maniacally focused on is continue to grow daily active users retain daily active users that are using the product, which is going to encourage people to start building more apps, more apps, more users and that's the kind of ping pong for the social network and I think the last thing is, to, you know, there are not that many examples of people trying to build both a social network and a protocol at the same time, actually mass it on is probably the only other example, and they've been working for, you know, five years and only had a little bit of growth recently based on this kind of Elon stuff, and even that it was actually temporary. So, my view is rooms not built in a day, and anyone who's trying to think that that's going to happen. They're not thinking on a long enough term mindset. Yeah. And the way I think you're getting is also kind of unique it's like you're not getting like Facebook did, where it's, you know, just people at Harvard or just Ivy League schools to start or whatever you're kind of curating the community really yourself, aren't you're still kind of talking to pretty much every user that comes on and it's all kind of through you. I think, and to me that has been a really good strategy because the feed is really unique and forecaster it's like it's very different than my Twitter feed where it's all about the current thing and, you know, whether if FT x the current thing everything on Twitter is FT x and forecaster there's no FT x it's it's it's kind of unique, kind of, like you said forecaster natives that are talking about different things, they talk a little bit or just how you you've gated. Yeah, so I'm a big believer in programs, do things that don't scale, like at each part of the startup, there's probably a new thing you can kind of fake it till you make it and manually do something longer than you think. And so we're about 8000 people in the beta. I onboarded the first 400 manually, so like a 1530 minute zoom call like this walking through got a really good understanding of the user experience. And so I think we've been able to polish that pretty well and anecdotally I think the feedback is like this is as good as any web three onboarding. But I think the, the next stage, I had to shift from I can't do every individual onboarding. And so what I did is I shifted it to my Twitter DM inbox, we experimented with a couple different things but this one worked because one, you're a good candidate if you're already active on Twitter like like the reveal preferences if you're if you're tweeting and using that network in a good way, you're probably most likely to, you know, convert in a good way for forecaster versus if you've never used Twitter, like jumping into forecaster right away, probably low like that you're going to retain the second thing also, which is, I think underrated is I have a direct line of communication to every single one of the users on forecaster in an app that even if they stop using forecaster or gets uninstalled from their phone. I have high confidence they probably still have Twitter. And so the ability to DM. Basically, any churned user and ask for feedback has been really helpful from a product standpoint, and one nice thing is there's some friction right you have to DM me to get on forecaster I have to kind of take a quick look at your profile say sure I invite you. But because of that kind of initial connection. I've had like a really really high hit rate to be able to reach out to anyone and they're willing to give me, you know, two messages worth of feedback. And so over the last two years, the aggregate amount of feedback from churned users who usually if you were to send them an email survey they're never going to fill that out it's kind of loaded in their inbox versus a direct message from someone that they already previously messaged with is a bit of a hack just in terms of attention. And so I think that that's really been informative for just how we've iterated on the product. And so we're getting to the end of this like I were about to launch kind of user driven invites but I think a lot of the lessons that I've learned both in the kind of like how to make sure onboarding is really smooth, if I'm not there to help people, as well as the, the kind of customer user feedback side of things I think we're going to build into our invite process that that's driven by users. Yeah, that's smart. Yeah, I've had a bunch of LPS have asked for invites. Over the months, and there was a link at one point but I think what I've been saying now is just dm. Yeah, and if anyone's listening, if you send a dm to me on Twitter I'm DWR three letters, and just put the word Indiana in there. I got a lot of spam inbound so by using those keywords it just bubbles it up to the top and then I can make sure you get an invite right after this. Sweet. One thing I'm curious about how does the feed work to me, the feed is one of the most important, if not the most important kind of issues around social networks right now, and especially with Twitter. I mean, Twitter seems to have gone back to this kind of algorithmic feed, it's really hard to use chronological is not default. And it's, it's even confusing for me, like, I think, being transparent about the feed and the way the feed works is like an important way for a new social network to differentiate and just to provide a better service to users. Right now though, even I have the same question about the forecaster feed like I'm, it's not clear to me how it works. So, maybe, how does it work. Do you plan to be transparent about that or do you plan to be more so talk a little bit about that. Yeah, so fortunate thing for me is I'm a 15 plus year Twitter power user so I strong opinions on the Twitter products so when I got to build my own feed. One, I think I have a generally a pretty high quality bar so wanted to say something that I would be happy with. In general, I think people have been overall pretty happy. The default to start with reverse chronological. So here's the challenge with that so one for a power user that's great, you have full control, you kind of understand the German mystic I post, like, and I'm following you, it's going to be at the top of the feed, there was no mucking around things. The reveal preference though is consumers like algorithmic feeds, if they're good. Obviously, Tick Tock is a great example of this where you don't even have a follow model for the most part for most users and it's just an endless stream of, you know, ups and downs based on your reveal preference on how long you watch those videos. So, I think where we have been really kind of focused initially is keep the initial feed, because the types of people who are signing up right now are power users, so that they're going to bias towards wanting if I follow user that's what I want to see the content and I want to see other content, the two things that we will obviously one, we have a concept of like a retweet, so recast so if someone I'm following recast that's that's one way you get content outside of who you're directly following. And the second thing that we've been a little bit more aggressive compared to something like Twitter is we're really focused on conversations, and my view is Twitter, Twitter is at its worst. When people are using Twitter as a broadcast platform, and really don't care about any of the engagement they're just strictly trying to drive eyeballs to whatever podcast video website, they're not actually using Twitter as a conversational platform they're strictly using it as a one way broadcast platform. So, what we wanted to optimize for is the, the conversations that are actually having other people responding. And so the simplest thing is anytime someone replies to a conversation on forecaster in the core feed and assuming you're following those people that gets bumped up to the top. So inevitably if there's, there's an active conversation that that that kind of unit of kind of cast tweets, effectively, will sit at the top of your feed all day. And so it's just kind of, that's, that's, that's the way the algorithm works. And what's great is is actually the number of average replies to a cast compared to like even a sampling of tweets for myself is way higher. And also, that is actually informed our recommendation algorithms where this is the first time we're using machine learning, who to follow. And then we actually have this feed called highlights which is more like a tick tock where we're just trying to surface the data, but we've been explicit in making it focused on the most active conversations versus something that I don't know is like a joke, it gets a ton of likes but no one is no one is actually really going back and forth on that. Here's the important thing though, because forecaster is an actual protocol, and we'll have permissionless access to the underlying data and API's, you are going to have dozens of clients and dozens of different algorithms and approaches. That can suit different consumer preferences. And I think that's actually one of the motivating things for me to be working on this is, I don't claim to have the perfect algorithm. And I think that, you know, consumer preferences are very varied and diverse and yes there may be a couple of dominant ones, but that's okay to have like a long tail of kind of more niche products. And I think, just imagine, for example, if email was essentially administered spam algorithm. You know how like quickly that would get captured by whatever group of people and then they would decide oh well this is not spam but this, this content shouldn't make it to the like front of email algorithms. We don't have that we have a market based solution where Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, and a whole long tail are out there. And so actually what you get is you get much better behavior it's really really honed in on what is what is a consumer actually want versus, oh we have this kind of like monopoly on on the content moderation. How can we actually go use this for for what other pets, and so so for me that the imperative here is actually not build the best algorithm, although we want to have as good of an algorithm as we can in our client, it's actually more about get to a place where we can work with thousands of other clients with other algorithms that can suit different consumer preferences. Have you. Is there a way to see like exactly the way the algorithm works, either in the app or have you written about this or anything yet. No, it's a good push. I think the following algorithm is extremely simple there's no machine learning, it's just like the only time you'll see things that people that you're not following in a reverse chronological order are recast. And so indeed, that is a kind of like proto ml headed in the direction of kind of more of like a tick tock type thing.

# Decentralized Social Networks with Dan Romero and Nick Tomaino [U2b35wbfabI]_part2

Can you set the default to highlight right now or no? No, that's the other thing is I can't stand that Twitter. I've been using Twitter for 15 plus years and every time I get to the app, I don't wanna see the algo. I wanna see the following first. I'll tap the algo if I'm bored. Yeah, got it. But here, like to be intellectually honest though, consumers, like the average consumer prefers the algo. They do not prefer reverse chronological. That is a power user feature. But a network like Twitter is interesting in that the power users are the ones that create the actual liquidity and the content. So you have to provide power users, I think with the best possible experience. And on the margin, they're gonna create more compelling content, which is actually gonna pull in the people who want the algo feed. I think this is what Twitter is always not kind of like rock, right? Like if I'm above a certain number of followers on Twitter and I'm posting on a regular basis, I should never see an ad of my feed. Like there are not that many people on Twitter like that. Like all they should be doing is trying to focus on, it's like, how can I get this person to post more? Because this is actually going to bring in the 200, whatever their fake metric they've had. They've had this like monetizable DAU number, which anytime you see a social network that doesn't use DAO, just like Facebook, it's coke. It's basically, we aren't Facebook. We don't wanna be compared to Facebook. We don't actually have a compelling enough product to drive DAO. And so they come up with all these other metrics. Talk to anyone who's like, Facebook has the two best metrics from a social network standpoint, DAO and time spent. And I think there was a question in the chat that says, how do you measure reveal preference? Daily active users. Like that's the only number you should be looking at because to be a daily active user, that's a vote of utility every single day, right? Like to keep coming back. Probably means that the app is on their home screen. Monthly active user, I can send you an email that kind of like tricks you into clicking on the app and all I have to do with that is once a month. Like it is a completely different mindset to build an app that someone would wanna use every day, let alone multiple times a day. And I think that is something that we're really focused on because that is the ultimate vote of, are we building something useful as people are willing to use it every single day. Do you think about the question of whether, you said that what users want is the algorithmic feed that just drives engagement, but do you consider that what users want might actually be bad for them? And is that something that you think about in building the product, particularly as a protocol kind of first that might have a different business model than advertisement, right? Because in the case of Twitter, and maybe they're trying to get away from this now, but like what users want might be bad for them, but it also aligns with the business model. So I think there's different considerations. I'm curious how you balance that. And maybe you disagree with my premise that what users want might be bad for them, but. Yeah, I'm generally at the point of view is that the market actually is, going back to the stated versus revealed preference. If you have a true market and it's kind of like the barrier to entry is low, which today in social networks, you get these massive network effects and then they can actually be rent extracting. Monopoly is not the right word, but within their social graph, they effectively are. Television is a great example of this. So when television didn't have kind of like barriers, the barriers to entry was extremely high, right? Like spectrum, and like you only had a few networks. There's a very limited, like A, what was allowed to be on TV in terms of content. The format was pretty standard. It's like, okay, advertising based. Like you couldn't opt in. HBO comes along with the beginning of cable. And then as over time, as you kind of like lower the barrier to entry, and then especially with the internet where effectively streaming, like you could just kind of come over the top, like the reveal preferences, consumers actually are willing to pay some amount of money for baseline better content, right? Like network television is effectively toast relative to Netflix or HBO or Disney Plus. And so I think that that is what I wanna get to for social media is can we actually get to a market where there's a sufficient network effect happening at a protocol level that you actually get to see a competing set of approaches, right? You have the paid clients, the subscription, the HBO equivalent. You have the ad free with ads, which I think a lot of people will still pick those types of clients. You'll have the algorithmic clients that are like totally engaging in terms of just trying to suck you in for multiple hours at a time, versus like one of the approaches that we have for our client is if I get people to pay as a subscriber, A, I shift them from a user to a customer. And then I actually care much more about something like NPS. So like customer satisfaction of versus time spent, right? If you're an advertising based platform, the only number that matters for you if you wanna make more money is increasing time spent, which then shows you more ads, right? Whereas in an environment where I all of a sudden have paying subscribers, maybe what my paying subscribers are saying to me is I want a better signal to noise ratio. Show me less content in my feed, but using algorithms, show me the most relevant for me. And then at a certain point say, hey, everything else after this is gonna be doom scrolling. I think for a busy person who's trying to make informed decisions about the world, they would be willing to pay a lot for that, right? And so I think that the key is getting to a marketplace of ideas and a marketplace of clients and approaches. And then going back to the state versus reveal preference, we're gonna see what actually most consumers want or different populations of consumers. Makes sense. What are some of the most interesting, I mean, you don't wanna highlight maybe one or the other, but are there any, from a user perspective, products kind of built on Farcaster that you really like? I mean, for me, SearchCaster, and I'm guessing you are as well as a Twitter power user, but I use Search quite a bit. And the one thing that Farcaster lacks in the client right now, I think is Search. And so SearchCaster, if anyone wants to check it out, I dropped it in the chat, but it's kind of one of my favorite products that's kind of built on the open data layer, but maybe talk about a few that you think are particularly interesting. Yeah, so SearchCaster was great in the sense that it was permissionlessly built. Had no idea, Greg Skriloff, just recent college graduate, just built it because he was excited about searching what was on Farcaster. And from our internal prioritization, we were saying, well, there's not enough content on Farcaster right now to justify us going and spending time on Search versus some other feature. But the beauty of a protocol is if you're not solving what the market wants or someone's preference, they can go build it. And so I think SearchCaster is just like a great encapsulation of you actually increase the aggregate amount of output or innovation that's happening in the ecosystem when it is permissionless and open. So we actually haven't felt the compelling need to go build Search now because SearchCaster exists, right? And you can imagine as Farcaster grows as a protocol, being the search engine for the protocol could end up being something that's pretty valuable. I'd fully expect, by the way, that there are gonna be much of other competitors to SearchCaster. So I think that's the kind of the flip side of the coin here is that you actually have to constantly be building the best consumer experience or kind of like product experience because the barrier entry is so low, which I think is exciting because at the end of the day, then you get the best consumer experience possible because everyone's competing for that attention. I think where I'm most excited right now is we have a bunch of other clients being built. And so maybe that term kind of can get confusing. The simplest example here is just think of like web browsers. That's a client for the web, the original one Netscape, then in Microsoft, then you have Firefox and Chrome and Safari. And so I think where we are today is we're kind of like the Netscape equivalent. And what we're hoping is that there's actually a bunch of other people who can provide that same core gateway service to the protocol. And for the first two years, no one was interested in it. And I think last year we had our first like kind of like fully featured, like gonna show you a feed and another client, Discov, again, permissionless built by a developer in Berlin. And then as of the start of this year, we have, I'm aware of at least six teams that are working on clients that could fully replace, like you would never have to use our main client. And so this is kind of, again, going back to that idea of like, if we had judged the success of the protocol after the first year, we basically had no developer interest, might as well just shut it down. But I think for us, it's always been about consistent growth of the total daily active users of the protocol is going to be the thing that actually attracts developers. And the analogy I always like to use is the iPhone. So when the original iPhone came out, they sold somewhere between five and 10 million of them. There was no third-party app store. You could, the only like first-party apps were built by Apple. Apple even built the YouTube and Google Maps apps. And so it's easy to forget that for that first year, they were the one just selling the device based on the existing feature set. And once they got to that kind of initial community of, and if you're carrying around a phone, you're a daily active user of the phone, that's the second year when they launched the app store. And then even then, those first couple of years, if you actually just look, like you type TechCrunch, like top apps in the app store 2009, most of those apps don't exist today. And it took a few years for people to natively understand, oh, this is the capability of this device that people are carrying around all the time. You get the WhatsApps, you get the Instagrams, you start to get the actual like mobile native companies that have grown up while this is a platform. And I think that that's the same thing that's happening with Farcaster where the initial set of ideas are kind of like tinker projects. And then I think that they start to get more sophisticated as you've grown the total number of people on the protocol, because that's actually what developers care about. They don't care about the underlying technology of a protocol for the most part. They care about is liquidity. And in the case of DeFi, that's total value locked or whatever. And in the case of social, it's daily active users, right? Like the liquidity that generates the both the posts, but the eyeballs, right? How do you incentivize developers? Because I guess like the app store example, developers came because there were users, but also because there was a way to make money. I guess first just in the app store charging for your app, but also advertising became kind of a business model. So what do you, it's awesome that there's six clients in the works right now. How are these developers thinking about incentives? And do you think kind of incentive alignment between yourself as Merkle, the company, and the developers is important? Maybe share more on how you're thinking about that. Yeah, so I'm back to the markets thing. I think if you just strip away all incentives, hackathons, all these other kinds of stuff, the thing that developers care about is I wanna build something and I want people to use it. And so driving the total number of addressable daily active users and making sure the technology works, right? Like right now, like we have a bunch of stuff that we still need to kind of go figure out, but here's a simple example. With Farcaster, where we should be in the next six months is you see an app in your feed that is kind of Farcaster enabled. You can tap that. It's gonna take you to that app. And then you can kind of swipe once to just kind of sign in with Farcaster. And then that app magically has access to your kind of credentials in the background. And then you can go use that. Getting to that level of just kind of distribution for kind of like a crypto or web three app where you're not having to muck around with MetaMask or any of these other things. And it just kind of feels much more like installing an app from the app store. I think that is a 10X improvement for developers to be able to get the distribution and people to actually go use their app. And the thing I would push on is, yeah, the app store let you charge money, but Apple actually charges for that. And in theory, you could do it outside the app store. The reveal preferences consumers really enjoy this like really seamless experience to get an app. And so I actually think convenience, and this is something that we learned at Coinbase, that's a reveal preference for consumers. Yes, you can go store your Bitcoin or Ether, whatever you have with a user controlled wallet. But the reveal preferences is that most people like to keep it safe on Coinbase because that's password reset and all these other kinds of things. And so I think where we're really focused on is if we can make this the most seamless way to onboard into kind of like web three or crypto. And in most cases, the user doesn't even necessarily even need to know about it. But then the kind of, I always use the mullet example. It's like kind of feels web two in the front, business in the front, and then like party web three in the back. But like that's the actual architecture of Farcaster. And so you get to a place where we make it really, really easy to onboard. We're growing the total number of daily active users in this ecosystem. And I can actually show like, hey, people are using this app every single day. Like we're focused on DAOs, not MAUs. Developers are gonna show up. Like they're desperate for growth. They're desperate for that set of first thousand or 10,000 users. And so I think that is the single biggest thing that we can do to drive developer adoption versus any thing on the margin. I think if we get to some level of scale, we will have the ability to kind of figure out because there is going to be a fee associated with a Farcaster account, but you can kind of think of it as like Twitter blue, but you're paying a smart contract on Ethereum. And from that, I think we can, if we can prove that we can get a scaled number of users to pay for a premium account to a protocol, then I actually think you can think about how do you divvy that up? Maybe some developers are actually contributing more to the usage of that. So maybe they get rewarded for that, but that's so far in the future. And I think that the primary focus is just continue to drive the total number of daily active users in the ecosystem. Got it. So do you think, I think there's not, you could argue it's not at scale, but there's a number of people using Farcaster right now that would pay right now. Do you think that would be something that you kind of add even before you open it up to more people and maybe ungate it? Or how are you, and maybe are there metrics that you're tracking before you want to ungate it? Maybe talk a little bit about just how you're thinking about roadmap. Yeah, so we have three big milestones to get the protocol to what I would say is kind of like a credibly neutral permissionless, something that I would actually, from an intellectual honesty standpoint, say this is a permissionless Ethereum. So the first is we have to get this kind of special server out a node for the Farcaster network called the hub. So that's in May. And what's nice about that is after that's done, a developer can just go to GitHub, pull down this Farcaster hub code, run it in their own infrastructure, and they will have full access to the global state of the network. So there is no privileged like, oh, Merkle, because they created it, they have all this additional data. It's just, you get the exact same state and that's how Ethereum works. And I think that that's a critical component to being able to look a developer in the eye and say, hey, go build a business, spend the next few years trying to build something on top of this protocol. Because if you don't hit that level, you get to what happened with Twitter, which Twitter, the early days of Twitter, you had this robust third-party ecosystem of developers, strategy change in 2014, that got kind of handicapped. And then Elon shows up and then just overnight says, hey, sorry, the remaining Twitter API, that's getting deprecated in two weeks. So I think developers at this point are sophisticated enough to think about platform risk. And so getting to a place of that credible neutrality, the unruggable protocol from a social standpoint, that's really critical. Second thing is we need to get to Ethereum mainnet and prove that people are willing to pay for that premium account to the protocol. That's a hypothesis right now. I think to your point, there's a dedicated group of early users that are kind of indicating interest, but getting someone to part with their hard-earned cash, like that's a reveal preference and we need to get to that point. And then the third part is getting out of this gated state, right? Like how do you go from kind of Facebook gated.edu to anyone in the world can go sign up. And I think that comes down to, I'm just like relentlessly focused on just your standard retention metrics, right? So because it's gated right now, actually signups, like that's fine. Like most people we send a signup to are gonna make it through the signup, but the day one retention, day seven retention, day 30 retention of just like what percentage of users if they sign up, like come back 30 days later, I want that to be basically top 10% with any web two social network. And if we hit that point, which I feel pretty confident that we're gonna be able to get there this year, like we're already top 25%, but if we can get to top 10%, then you know that you have a machine that for every user you add into the machine, you're gonna retain X percent, like that becomes something that you can actually compound. And then I think you can shift more towards a growth mentality. The last thing that I think is interesting is I don't think we're ever gonna grow as fast as the traditional web two social networks because of this single on-chain fee, right? Like the rest of Forecaster's off-chain, the architecture I think is really, really designed to make it usable, but that on-chain fee, some people would say, oh, that's never gonna get you to a billion users. And the counter to that, I would say, is actually that might be fine for the foreseeable future because what you end up getting is you get built-in spam prevention, right? If it costs a dollar or $5 to just even sign up that initial account, and we can have it have a slick Apple Pay integration, you might even need to see the crypto, right? It can just happen behind the scenes, but then you don't run into any of these problems that Twitter has dealt with. And so what you can actually confidently say is if you have 10,000 followers on Forecaster, you have a much higher confidence that those are 10,000 real people. Like you could actually put them in a stadium and be there versus 10,000 followers on Twitter, like could end up being like 3,000 people in a bunch of bots. So I think shifting the narrative also around the quality of your audience. And the other thing we can do is we can measure the on-chain activity of those people. So now all of a sudden, and this is a biology concept, is you can actually start to measure the economy size, the on-chain economy size of your audience, right? Like biology, I always used to bring this up where he would say, imagine if Kim Kardashian could actually say the 200 million people who follow her on Instagram, like this is how much economic activity they generate. Well, with a network like Forecaster, and if you believe more stuff was gonna end up on chain, you can quantitatively in a permissionless way, like know exactly how much economic activity are the 10,000 people who are following me on Forecaster. And so I think that that, once we figured that out, I think then we're in a more of a growth mode because we're actually selling a different product than just something that looks like Twitter, but is not.

# Decentralized Social Networks with Dan Romero and Nick Tomaino [U2b35wbfabI]_part3

Yep, makes sense. Okay, we've got a few more minutes there's a few other questions I wanted to ask you I'm just curious about personally but one is identity. Right. How do you think about kind of the forecaster identity layer, you kind of, it seems you rather than kind of use ens or bootstrap some existing identity layer you kind of have created your own identity layer and presumably, you know the identity that I create on the main main forecaster client will persist across, you know, other clients. How do you think about that why because I guess why choose to build, create your own rather than bootstrap another and maybe how you see identity and for in the forecaster kind of ecosystem evolving. Yes, if you look at identity. It's it's trended in kind of one direction towards like kind of being simpler so the internet starts email is kind of like the first killer app. So that becomes the de facto identity that developers on the web use. And then mobile shows up and actually stuff shifts to phone numbers. And then if you actually just look at the at scale public social networks, they don't use a phone number they don't use email as your identifier they use a username. And so, like that that's just been a consistent trend and this is actually one of the reasons I think that the federated model of like kind of like weird username spaces is it just not it's not modern like people want to be at like like that's just the consumer preference. And so you need to kind of hit that that UX, and that doesn't sound hard but when you're trying to do in a decentralized system that actually gets tricky because you need to have a canonical representation of at Nick or at DWR. And so that's actually a lot of the the design of forecaster is like how can you make this done in a decentralized way but like reasonable ownership guarantees over that, while still being really usable. And then the second thing, if you take something like DNS, how many daily active users, does DNS have not people who have a wallet with an DNS in it like an actual application that DNS is like core to the user experience. And that's something that we started working on in 2020 like, and even today it's extremely low, like, no one is actually at mentioning DNS, they, they have it, they might put it in their Twitter bio, but the but the reality is is like, you're not actually building the core of an app where that is a core foundational component. And so I think that means you don't have to be beholden to anyone identities because there isn't actually an identity system and you should be building the best user experience. And so that's where we're starting and just saying, Okay, let's actually go build the user experience that we want. So, example with DNS unlimited number of characters. Okay, so I have a 32 character DNS name now does that get shown in the UI and it looks so clunky do I truncate it like, like, when you start to actually think through the product details of this, you realize that like hey Twitter and Instagram where they limit things to 16 characters, Latin only alphabet like from a product experience standpoint you quickly get to a solution and you realize like hey we're going to bootstrap our own because it's actually in service of our own product. And if you're focused on building a product that people are willing to use every day, you're going to make a different set of trade offs than some kind of open standard that you're hoping other people go and use, and so that's that's how we approach it. Makes sense. Yeah, agreed on, you know, I mean the main. Yeah, in terms of active users of DNS it's people trading DNS right. And we actually just invested in DNS vision which is a marketplace for DNS so I think there is activity, and there is a base of daily active users but maybe not the daily active users that you're interested in. Yeah, I mean to be super clear I actually am bullish on DNS I think DNS is great. I think of it much more akin to the domain name system, but how many people today have their own domain name, relative to the domain market is huge and domain self for a lot right now it's like NFTs, but it's a very different it's a prosumer or professional market versus the average user just wants something that's super simple. Yep. That's actually one of the primary reasons we, other than the decentralization and the and the kind of security that you get from the Ethereum L1, I think the composability of forecaster usernames within the existing ecosystem. So when you register a forecaster username, you know, think about it today on Twitter if you had a great username, and you wanted to sell it like a it's against Twitter's terms of service. I think Elon actually might be doing some type of auction system but 15 years later they have never done that. And if Twitter launches on mainnet later this year, day one it's, you can just go listen and open seat, like we don't have to build any of that economic infrastructure, any innovation that happens for an NFT on a theorem, we get out of the box. And so I think that that's the other thing that I think web to people. When they they look at forecaster and they've seen we've made a bunch of pragmatic approaches, then they always go well, you don't even need the blockchain you can just go do this and then they actually haven't thought deeply about like a there's actually a bunch of things that the blockchain solves from a product standpoint. Yeah, so it's useful in of its own right, but then they just don't get composability and they think that that that's irrelevant when the reality is that that's actually a whole nother layer of permissionless innovation that I'm just super excited to see where people take it. Right. I might have to hit you up for a few more forecaster usernames 10. Well, that's one of the other reasons we don't want to open it up great because if you if you open it up right now you're just going to have a bunch of people squat. Yeah, and that's, that's basically selling future value from the protocol to a bunch of people who kind of get in early and like we're again not in a short term like can we boost some price or something it's like we're building something for the long term. Yeah, I do think there is some economic benefit of that as well and just getting people, you know, that have aligned incentives with you for the thing to work but certainly there's an extreme way that could go that's that's negative. Yeah, and I would say like, I do think that the way to do it is you have a gated period at the beginning and at some point you have to pull the bandaid off and then go to the free market and let squatting happen that will happen. All right, Dan well thanks a lot for joining us really enjoyed the chat and appreciate you taking the time and I'll see you soon. Cool. And like I said, anyone who wants a forecaster invite just DM me on Twitter, DWR, and use the word, Indiana, and I'll send you today. Awesome.

# Farcaster ｜ Building a Sufficiently Decentralized Social Network with Dan Romero, Co-founder. [zAaKwu-G4DM]_part1

Hello and welcome back to Crypto Sapiens. I'm your host, Humpty Calderon. And today we're talking to Dan Romero, co-founder at Farcaster. In our conversation, we will talk about the rise of decentralized social, different levels of decentralization, and why Farcaster has chosen a sufficiently decentralized approach. And if you don't know what that means, it's okay, we're going to get into it. We'll also be covering the different identity systems that are used in Farcaster, as well as content moderation and decentralized networks, as well as exploring the permissionless innovation ecosystem that has been built for developers there. And this is evident by the growing number of applications that are being built there. So as always, there's lots to unpack here. So let's get started. So first of all, thanks for having me. I grew up in Massachusetts, went to school on the East Coast, worked in Boston for a few years, and then moved to Silicon Valley in 2013. And was looking to work in tech, something that I had kind of always wanted to do. And the first year I was working at a SaaS company and read the Bitcoin white paper. And ultimately got really excited about Bitcoin and the potential for cryptocurrencies as a new computing platform, right? 2013 is kind of like peak mobile era. Instagram had been acquired the year before, WhatsApp gets acquired the next year. And so I made the hop over to Coinbase in 2014, thinking that crypto was the next big wave in technology. And I think it was a little early on that. And arguably, it's still pretty early for crypto. But Coinbase ended up being the kind of like right place at the right time, at least within the crypto ecosystem. Albeit, the first two years were pretty slow. And I was there for a total of five years. And then in 2019, left, took some time off. And while I was off, reconnected with an ex-Coinbase colleague of mine, Varun Srinivasan. And we started working on some new, you know, potential ideas for a new project. And the idea that we both got excited about was answering the question, how could you make RSS competitive with Twitter? And so the initial name of the project was RSS Plus. And that ultimately turned into Farcaster, which we've been working on for the last two years. That's a really interesting trajectory. You know, and I had a question that I wanted to save for a little later, but it sounds like we're almost touching on it now. So I'm just going to start with that. And you know, one of the things that I've noticed personally is this introduction of decentralized social across a variety of different blockchains. You know, you have Lens over at Polygon. I've recently learned of Noster. Over at Lightning, we have Farcaster, which I believe would be an Ethereum-native application. Tell me a little bit about this idea of decentralized social as, you know, this killer app, if you will, on blockchains. Is that really like a monumental shift from the way that we think about blockchain? Yeah, so I think it's worth parsing apart. Why should we have a decentralized social network? Why is that important? And then the implementation. And so as it relates to the, you know, having a decentralized social network, I think I start from the place of the two things that we're really trying to optimize for are, one, anyone who has an audience on Forecaster, that relationship between, you know, themselves and their audience, that's direct. And so there's no third party that can come along and say, sorry, you violated a terms of service or we're going to arbitrarily kick you off the platform. And by the way, you lose access to the kind of like bi-directional relationship that you had kind of established on that platform. Two most prominent examples, if you spend a long time on Twitter building up an audience or you spend a long time on something like YouTube building an audience, they can just turn you off at any point. There's no ability to export your followers before you leave and say, hey, you know, follow me here, you know, contrast that to something like Substack, where if I am using Substack and I switch to using an alternative email newsletter, I'm able to move my subscriber list. That's a norm within the email network, which happens to be a web one decentralized permissionless network or protocol. And so that's the first thing that we're optimizing for with something like Forecaster. The second thing, and this is important because I think to make a protocol successful, you actually have to have many apps and services built on top of it. If it's just kind of like an open API for a company that can change, right? You can have a new regime show up and Twitter in the early days was actually a very open API ecosystem. And as of recently, they've effectively shut that entire third party ecosystem, at least from the client standpoint down. And that's a regime change, right? So you go from one group and there was the pre-public Twitter versus the post-public Twitter versus the Elon-owned Twitter. So that can change pretty quickly. Facebook, another good example, Zynga built on top of Facebook in the early days. They changed the way they were doing things or their strategy that disproportionately hurts Zynga. So the idea of platform risk is real. And what we're trying to do with a network like Forecaster is allow developers to have direct access to the data and APIs at the network level. And any relationship they have with the user is again, a direct relationship between the developer and the user, which is very common, obviously on the web or in email. Desktop software is pretty similar in the sense that, you know, if you download my browser, Apple probably isn't going to uninstall it from the machine, right? They probably would like to at this point, given how successful they've been with the iOS app store and the kind of wall garden approach there. But I think a lot of what happens in technology is if the norms are strong enough early on, they're very hard to change later. Whereas mobile, the modern era of mobile effectively has never been an open ecosystem. So therefore things tend to be a little bit more restricted. So with Forecaster, we were trying to make essentially an unruggable, you can't have someone pull out the rug from under you as a developer. And that's at the kind of protocol level. So direct relationship between a publisher, creator and their audience and direct relationship, data APIs and users for developers. And then as it relates to how there are different implementations of decentralized social networks. So you have, I'd say two buckets. So you have the ones that use blockchains, and then you have the ones that don't use blockchains. And the ones that don't use blockchains are actually larger in terms of total number of monthly active users. And they're a little bit older, Mastodon being the most prominent, but you have BlueSky, which is working on kind of another approach, which is federated. Nostra actually doesn't use a blockchain. It uses just public private keys. It's like Bitcoin friendly, and I would call it Bitcoin adjacent. Like you can do lightning payments in the apps, but from a fundamental where the identity lives, that is actually just a attestation. And that's actually one of the things that I would say we're trying to solve for with Farcaster is in the federated type systems, identity is actually a very tricky thing, at least from a user experience standpoint. Right? Yeah, we use email today, which actually uses the domain name system. But I think a lot of the challenges of email, right, phishing, and all of the stuff that I think if you're not as sophisticated of a user, you kind of sometimes get confused about email. That's because the system email was designed for really technical users, because it was an academic system originally that just, you know, took off. Contrast that to something like Twitter or Instagram, where you have just a simple at username, right? You can be at Humpty, I can be at DWR, and that there's only one, right? And so that is an optimization that can happen when you start to actually put the identity layer rather than it being federated. Okay? And every server design designs which identity you have. It moves to kind of a blockchain based model, where now the kind of identity is stored on chain, and then there are varying degrees of what else is stored on chain. So in the case of Farcaster, the only thing we do on chain is the identity mapping, because we think that that's actually the critical thing to take out of the hands of any one individual company, organization, country, right? Shouldn't live on a server, it should live kind of in this kind of credibly neutral common ground, which Ethereum can provide. And then for the rest of the stuff that we do with Farcaster, it's actually all off chain. So our view is, if you do stuff on chain, even if you're doing it on a cheaper chain, gas costs are going to increase over time, because by definition, as the chain gets more popular, the bandwidth can't increase infinitely. It just, there's a gravity to it. And so at some point, you're going to hit the max amount of block space. And so you either less decentralization on that chain, which that has a set of trade-offs, or you increase gas costs. And so our view is to use social media outside of maybe the signup, which is what we're betting on, it should be completely free, should just be like normal web 2. And so that's what our architecture does. I think some alternative blockchain-based decentralized social networks or protocols, they tend to put more stuff on chain. And our view is it doesn't actually solve anything by putting more stuff on chain. Yes, you might get a little bit of composability for, you know, if, for example, a follow or like is an NFT, then you can in theory sell it. But our bet is that most of those things don't actually matter from a composability standpoint. And what you really care about with a decentralized social network is if you go back to what people use centralized social networks for, at least the public ones, right? Like put Facebook in a messaging app to the side, because it's a slightly different use case. But the big public, I have a profile, anyone could follow me networks, it's about distribution, right? I'm assuming you have profiles on all these public networks. And then when you put out a podcast, you put a link to the podcast and all of them with the hopes of reaching the widest audience possible. And so our point of view is that is the problem to just like hone in and on and solve and sufficiently decentralized the network to the point where if the only thing that's on chain is the identity, and then you can actually have every piece of kind of content on Forecaster tie back to that identity on chain through a cryptographic signature is what we do, then you can actually get the best of both worlds in that you can get that kind of usability, the speed, you know, user experience, all that great stuff from Web2. And that's important because you're trying to get as many people to use it because then that actually attracts people who want to publish right that the audience. And then you also have the strong ownership guarantees of Web3, right? No company, country, individual can come in and muck around with. Yeah, it sounds like at least from what I'm taking away from what you've said pretty eloquently here is you're solving for distribution while still trying to or while also trying to provide the user with a level of self sovereignty and portability, right? And interoperability with their identity. I think that's pretty excellent. I like this idea too of considering efficiency in terms of how you're building out the platform. Because I don't think yet that we've seen a blockchain that claims to be faster and cheaper when they do become popular actually maintain that promise, right? Because as a blockchain becomes busier than obviously the, you know, transaction speeds might diminish a bit and the costs definitely go up. So that's an interesting way of thinking about it. And so this idea of decentralized enough, which I definitely hear and read a lot about when I think about Podcaster, I think resonates at least with me with what you've just said. One thing that I kind of want to explore, because you brought up identity and I kind of want to touch on this because it seems like also you're exploring how identity is works on Podcaster. You have two different identity systems, right? And so you have one identity system that's persistent and one that's that is changing, correct? Or changeable, not changing, but changeable. Yeah. Tell me a little bit about some of the challenges that you've seen in other identity systems where they're not changeable, where you get access to that, like at Humpty over on Twitter, for instance, and then I don't use it for years and then it just stays there unused. Or if I have my ENS, for instance, at Humpty, for instance, and I, you know, and someone else needs it, but I'm just sitting on it because I'm speculating on it. Are those some of the things that you're considering or is it something else? Our approach to how to make Podcaster work first starts with the product experience. And one of the important things here is we built the initial client. So none of this is abstract, like everything is rooted in how people use the app and the user experience and what's confusing for people, et cetera. Our point of view is that in 2023, we live in a world where Twitter exists, Instagram exists, usernames are a superior user experience than the equivalent of an email address. And I actually think that they're superior user experience to something like a phone number. So if you actually look at the history of identity systems on the internet, you start with servers, websites, move to email once you have these platforms that I can log in, use email as the identifier to be almost like the public and private key. But then the username actually lives within the system, right? My username on Twitter, my username on Instagram, and most websites implement some version of the username. So it's a concept of, I think, a popular consumer app where you have a global username, modulo, email, right? And then we can put that to the side. I think the next iteration that happened is instead of using email as the identifier, most mobile apps at scale used phone number, right? WhatsApp being a prominent example, but it's just a superior user experience for most people. Instead of having to muck around in their email, which might be hard to find, you can just get the text message. Google has that really nice thing, same with Google, where they pre-populate the code and it just kind of works. And so phone numbers are actually more popular than email addresses from a daily active user standpoint. If you think about most people globally, email is actually more of a web one or developed. You probably have a computer, not just a mobile phone. So I think that is the progression. And so from our standpoint is we are not going to regress from the username approach. And so what we can do is we can swap out the Ethereum address being the kind of like public and private key, the authentication mechanism, but the actual user experience, how a user uses the app, the identity should be kind of a simple human readable name, should be no more than 16 characters. I think Twitter actually nailed that. I think generally longer names get really confusing for people. I think Latin alphabet, for better, for worse, it's a constrained set of characters, right? So if you actually let any Unicode character be used, there's something called the homogliphic attack where there's a whole bunch of different subtle changes in the whole Unicode spec, like all the potential characters you can put on a computer that for the human eye, it looks like an E. And you've probably seen this. Sometimes there's like weird formatting in a tweet. It's actually because Twitter, I think, supports Unicode. So what people are doing, it's not like Twitter has like a little, like you can format in bold things. It's actually people writing Unicode and then putting it into the tweet, which if you were to like search for that, most search engines are doing a character match. And so actually like that isn't the same character to the computer, but to the human eye, it looks the same. And so you actually run into these issues where I could be DWR, but if I give the full Unicode set, you could be using a D that has like a little subtle pixel to the bottom that, you know, in some language actually makes sense. But for the average user, now they think this is DWR and it's actually a scammer. And so I actually do think Twitter and Instagram, like they've figured that out in the sense that like make the global namespace somewhat constrained and it actually increases trust. And then I think that the last thing on the identity side of things is what you mentioned. There's a concept of a fixed identifier on Farcaster. We call it an FID, the Farcaster ID, just the incrementing number of user you are. So if you're the 623rd user on Farcaster, that's your FID. And the smart contract just increments one at a time. You can't like get your own or the whole point is not to switch. It's supposed to be subtracted away from the user, but it's important because if you actually think about how a system like Twitter or Instagram works, you're not represented by your username internally. You're represented by the database ID number and when you signed up, because in both cases, you are able to change your username, which is actually a very friendly user thing, right? You can turn it off, maybe you have a less great username, get really popular. You know, you're using this as a creator to do your business and maybe people think that it doesn't matter, but people actually get emotionally tied to these names. So if you can go from like, imagine if it was like Humpty1237 and then eventually you got to Humpty, you want that ability to change the name. If everything is mapped to a username, so if you were to use an ENS as a name on a social network, in a user controlled decentralized social network, you can't force someone to follow a different username. So you actually would never upgrade your username. So it's a less desirable user experience. And so by separating the Forecaster ID, which is permanent and the username, you can retain your followers and all of the kind of stuff that you've done while being able to swap in potentially a new username. And effectively, as your identity changes over time, which there is a component to all of our identity that changes, you're able to do that. And so that's actually something that's like, I think, really important. And if you actually think a lot of these systems, if you map to a username, by definition, if the system is user controlled, right, it's like there is no central authority that can just map everything again, over from a following standpoint, you're locked into a username. And so if you're on a server on Macedon, right, just like an email address, and they kick you off and everyone's following that you lose your audience. So it's actually, you know, like, potentially even more capricious and arbitrary, because at least Twitter, like if they de-platform a high profile person, because it's so big, it's going to attract some amount of attention. So there's this natural check, and maybe you believe Elon doesn't want to get people off the platform. But if you're on some small 500 person Macedon server, but you've built up a big audience and the server admin kicks you off, you lose that audience. And so I think it goes all the way back to is that these public social networks are about allowing people with an audience to have more sovereignty over that audience. And the way to do that is by creating a community.

more sovereignty around the identity, but most importantly, the pointer to say, hey, this is where to find me on the internet. And the username, I think, is a pretty good version of that. But email is a great example of this. People say, oh, that's theoretical or whatever. The reality is, if I have an email newsletter and I'm using Substack, I can point, and I was using a custom domain, I can just change the MX record to a new mail server and overnight start mailing from that new service, and my users don't even know. And so that's an important thing, because now it allows exit for whether you're kind of an individual user who doesn't have a lot of audience and you just want to be able to move between clients. But more importantly, if you have a big audience, you can actually use the software provider that is providing you with the best service, not the biggest audience, but then you're locked into whatever their terms of service. So before I move on, I want to say that if I could get at Humpty on Twitter, I would be very happy. So when I went to FariCaster, I made sure that I got at Humpty, because that does mean something to me. It's special to be able to identify as who I am on these platforms in the most efficient way possible. And so being able to do that on FariCaster was a thrill. You said something just now that really struck a chord with me, and that is you're able to move to the platform that's providing the best service. I think one of the things that Web3 enables is that because you're not tied, you know, your identity, your data isn't tied to one platform. You know, these platforms are now having to compete and actually deliver a better product. They're not necessarily having or kind of benefiting from locking in their users and saying, ha ha, you can't go anywhere. It's more the sense we have provided a client, a platform, a protocol with the best user experience. Give this a try, because this is where you're going to find your tribe. This is where you're going to be able to grow your audiences, where you're going to be able to share your content in the best possible way. Tell me a little bit about like that as maybe or if it is as a something that inspires FariCaster as a team, as an organization, in terms of what it's building from the protocol and the client level. So I'm a big fan of permissionless innovation. That's the original thing that got me excited about Bitcoin and Coinbase. At the time, people were building some rudimentary but exciting, what I thought was exciting, apps on top of the Coinbase API. And just contrasting that to FinTech, and FinTech APIs have improved over the last 10 years, right? Like Plot has made that a lot easier and things like that. But at the time, I was looking at that going, oh, wow, you can either deal with payments with all this kind of like legacy core stuff, or you can have this internet native currency, and you can kind of build micropayments, you can build streaming payments, you can build basically, your imagination is the limiting factor. And I think it's worth delineating that a lot of people are always like, well, all those ideas are terrible. Well, that's irrelevant, in my view, in the sense that what you're doing is you're allowing the aggregate creativity of the internet by making something permissionless, and not having any friction to get started effectively. I think that that is an underrated thing, because we've lived for the last 10 years in kind of an increasingly big tech environment. But prior, I think a lot of this interesting experimentation and all the experimentation that still happens on the web today is permissionless. And so it's like, if anyone says that that's not valuable, then, okay, like, I think they're being hypocritical, right? It's like, chat GPT did not have to get permission from Google to launch chat GPT, right? They're able to do it as a website. They didn't even have to go do it as an app, because we still have the open web. And so my point of view is, we already have this big permissionless platform called the web. But there are a bunch of other kind of what I would call what you want to call marketplaces or things that have supply demand, liquidity, that are siloed, that have gotten big as a result of the internet, right? Because the internet gives you distribution. But the innovation has slowed, because it's one company monopolizing that specific pool of liquidity, right? I think a good example of this is Airbnb. Airbnb, yes, you can go to VRBO or some of these other sites. But the reality is, is if you want to kind of rent a house that has some nice aesthetic characteristics, Airbnb is going to have the best liquidity and supply there. But as a result of not having any client competition, because they own that proprietary supply, Airbnb can do all these user frustrating things where it's like, oh, we're going to show you a fee, and then the cleaning fee and the taxes get added in later. Or like, basically, users have to complain, and that's all they can do. Like, yeah, they could vote with their feet. But the reality is, is like, they're going to use the supply even despite the bad experience. With that said, if you could actually now say Airbnb, that marketplace, like that supply was a protocol, okay? Doesn't have to have a blockchain. Just take the approach of that you have a common standard that any one company can actually offer that same supply. And then they're able to provide some level of the trust that Airbnb provides, right? Because the reason Airbnb is successful is that, yeah, they got the supply, but more importantly, there's some baseline level of trust. Like, if you have an accident that happens there as the homeowner, Airbnb is going to cover you and then as the guests they are. And as they hit that scale, they can kind of create that convenience and trust. I think another example, and this is something that I learned in crypto in my first five years in crypto, was at Coinbase. So you can go buy Bitcoin at a bunch of other places. Bitcoin by definition is a commodity and it's completely fungible. And like a Bitcoin bought on Gemini or Binance or Square or Robinhood, it's the same Bitcoin that you would buy at Coinbase. There's nothing special about Coinbase. Coinbase is also more expensive. And so the fact that Coinbase still continues to grow in terms of the total number of users and has a meaningful business and is much bigger than a lot of their competitors who are charging lower fees for the same thing goes to the fact that you are competing on a set of things that people value beyond just the base level price commodity tradeoff. We're not like these like perfect economic actors that only optimize on price. It's like people care about brand, they care about security, they care about UX. And I think Ben Thompson actually has a great blog post on this called What Clayton Christensen Got Wrong. And so for those who don't know, Clayton Christensen wrote this book, The Innovator's Dilemma, and he talks about how in markets you have low end disruption, start kind of in an area that the incumbents don't think is valuable because it's like low margin, it's kind of like not worth their time, they want to spend time on high margin stuff. And then they work their way up the value chain and ultimately disrupt the incumbent because they've eaten the profit margin the whole way up or they've just been able to operate better. And so he made this prediction that Android was going to disrupt the iPhone, right? It's like iPhone, fine, it's luxury good, but like it's going to have low end disruption. And obviously that hasn't happened. And the reason is consumers are not the same as businesses. So in business, you actually have a lot more rational, like it's a lot more dollars and cents most of the time. But with consumers, there's an aesthetic, there's emotion, there's brand. It's like, why are you wearing the clothes that you're wearing? Is it because of the technical characteristics or it's how it makes you feel or kind of how you want to be seen in the world? And so this is a long rant to go back to, if we can get to a place where the kind of big systems that got built up during the Web 2 era can move towards being protocols. Again, I'm going to like be really clear. Brand is not like the answer, it's just like there's a tool that you can use if that's the right tool to use to get things to be protocols. And I actually think that the primary way that this is going to happen is you just have a rational people like Varun and myself, it's kind of irrational to start working on a Twitter competitor when Twitter is at scale. And we just say, hey, well, we want to build something that's a protocol and decentralized. And by the way, we have 99%, 98% market share on Farcaster today, albeit very small user base. It's completely fine if we get down to 10 or 20% market share with our client, assuming we continue to grow the protocol, because then the protocol is successful. And I think that cynical people will quickly show up and say, hey, well, what's to stop you? Go from 8,000 people on a beta today to 8 million. Why don't you just change it so that you're like, I'm sorry, just like Twitter, no more open API. And I would tell you, you should continue to be really skeptical and cynical, despite me saying all these things, until Farcaster actually hits a bar that it is permissionless. And so that's actually what we're working on. And so we're working on this thing called Farcaster hubs. And you can think of a hub is like what an Ethereum node is for the Ethereum network. A Farcaster hub is for the Farcaster network. But when these are ready later this year, not designed for the average user, but more importantly, any developer can go to GitHub, they're going to be able to download a Farcaster hub, spin it up pretty quickly. It's going to sync with all the other hubs on the network, kind of like BitTorrent or Ethereum. And then you have full global access to the state of Farcaster, the data and APIs. And you as a marginal developer, one man shop or one woman shop, you can compete with the big company in the space. And then that is an equal playing field. And so until we get there, that's me all just promising and people should be skeptical. But once that exists, you don't have to trust me. You can just test it out for yourself and say, does this actually work? And so that's my general view of it is Web3, I think, gets way too wrapped up in crypto. I love crypto. I think crypto has a lot of really useful characteristics and properties. But I think that the jargon wars is like it just makes people batty, especially on Twitter. But I think what Web3 means to me is the foundation of what you're building is a protocol. So you're going to compete on service quality. And then the ability to exit with interoperability, it's a little bit of a mouthful, but it's important so that if I am providing you with access to Farcaster right now, assuming we hit that kind of like Web3 protocol bar, in my view, if you don't like how we're providing service, you don't like the algorithm we're doing, you don't like the UI and someone has something better, you're a couple of clicks away from switching over. And then there is no gimmick where we're locking you in and not letting you leave. It's like, nope, that's the ethos of this thing. And that's actually how the norms are set up. And going back to my original point about email, those initial norms can go a really long way. And if you've invested the time and energy into trying to make the protocol really healthy from the beginning, then it gets really difficult for a big, big company to come in and push everyone out and then close things down because the cat's out of the bag at the beginning. So you said something that I think I'd like to get a little clarification on. So you were talking about Farcaster hubs and how these, we could see them as nodes in the Ethereum blockchain that hold a state of the network, right? Yeah, on Ethereum, if there is not consensus with the way that the protocol is moving, they can basically come to a fork in the road, literally, and have two different versions of that protocol. It sounds like to me in the future, as long as there is an agreement that Farcaster is working in the best way possible for its community and for itself, it will continue to operate as Farcaster. However, it sounds like there could also be a chance where if there are disagreements between the Farcaster hubs, similar to these nodes, they could potentially fork. And as a user, you have the option of using one or the other, right? You have that optionality. So in terms of the interoperability on exit, which I think was a term you used, you have that both if there was a fork of the Farcaster protocol, but it sounds like also you could potentially have that same interoperability at exit from the Farcaster clients. If there was another client that would be built on the singular Farcaster protocol. So there's this kind of flexibility too, in terms of how the protocol works and how the client works and the different options that users like myself have to have the best user experience overall. Yeah, so I think that what's important is a fork with Ethereum or fork with Bitcoin. The state of the network is actually pretty critical because if I have a Bitcoin on this chain and I have a Bitcoin in this chain, and if you're trying to get a Bitcoin from me, which chain do I trust? That actually, that double spend potential is the thing that actually drives consensus. And we've actually found is, you know, it was theoretical hard fork before the Bitcoin cash one and then the Ethereum, Ethereum classic one. But basically the other chain never dies. And so there's kind of like a weird split and then, and then the there generally so far has been consensus on one other. I think with Farcaster, it's slightly different in that one, there's no spend, right? It's just a post and any one post, you know, is not the end of the world probably, you know, maybe there are some rare exceptions, but the other thing is you can actually simultaneously be consuming from, from both chains if that was to really happen because you don't have to worry about is this authentic or not? You just care about is the signature correctly mapped to that identity, right? And so you can actually kind of just simplify Farcaster, the hubs, they have a consensus algorithm like a blockchain, but they don't actually have to solve for double spends. So thus you don't have, you know, gas fees or things like that. And so we actually use something called the CRDT. It's technical. But the idea is that what we're betting on, and I do think that this has worked for Bitcoin because you know, they could in theory change the block size or whatever, but miners, you know, generally have aligned with the core developers. And so that despite you know, people wanting this to happen, you can actually drive to some level of social consensus, which actually drives how the blockchain works. Same thing with with Farcaster is ultimately if you're using Farcaster, going back to this idea of what we're optimizing for is you want distribution. And so you're going to be less likely as a, especially a big publisher with a large audience, you're not going to want to use a client that is not maximizing the distribution reach to the network. And so the game theory here that at least we believe this and we'll see how it plays out over the next few years, is your incentive is to kind of always make sure as many people as possible get access to the content. And then you will for your users, you want to get it as fast as possible to them. And so there's actually just a basic economic incentive that you're providing us client in the ecosystem, you're going to kind of want to be following the kind of like the fact that the default implementation. And it's also important is that we've built the initial client, and we're going to continue working on this client. And so the reference client, the initial one that exists is going to be following these practices. So you even if you have someone come in and they grow really fast, and they start trying to hijack the network, there's always going to be hopefully a credible alternative, as long as we're running this main client, you know, 20 years from now, maybe that's not the case. But hopefully by then, if it's worked at that level, you're going to actually have such a big market that you're going to have many different clients. And if anyone client starts to not follow the kind of the norms of that network, people will switch. So thanks for that. I think I'd like to go back to something you said earlier, and that's permissionless innovation. And I personally being someone that's at least on a regular basis opening up my Forecaster app, I do see the number of different developers that are coming in to the platform, and that are sharing the different things that they're building, you know, on Forecaster. Tell me a little bit about this idea of opening up the platform, the protocol to developers to be able to innovate and build, you know, different things, whether that is a Forecaster client or something else. I was going through your Twitter, and I think you do a really amazing job at highlighting some of the different things that are getting built on the Forecaster ecosystem. I've met a couple of amazing people there that are building things like Disco, for instance, right? And even you shared a tweet about like Forecaster Hubs being a contribution or something from a different developer. I think it sounds obvious why you would want to open up a system that way. But just maybe give me a little bit more context to someone who's developing a platform like Forecaster to have this open system where anybody can come in and contribute. So our initial beta launch now, two years ago, or a year and a half ago, we did not put any effort into the developer platform. So we launched the V1 of the Forecaster beta, barely checking the box that you could run Forecaster without using our servers. It would require a lot of technical work. You would have to kind of like deal with a bunch of stuff. There were going to be breaking changes from our end. But it did work from day one, from an architecture standpoint. We've kept it in a private beta, actually. One of the primary reasons is we just haven't hit a bar where you can actually hit that permissionless innovation where you don't have to ask anyone. You can just show up, download a hub, sign up on the blockchain, you know, without asking anyone and then get going. Today, you have to ask me for an invite via DM. API keys are administered until the hubs are ready through us. So there's a little too much centralization for us to actually be in an intellectually honest way, publicly promoting Forecaster as like, get signed up, like it's sovereign, right? Like it is very much a beta. That said, there are plenty of people who are interested in using it. So we appreciate everyone who has thus far. But what happened was for the first nine months, no one built anything on the permissionless APIs. And there was no documentation really or whatever. But then what happened is as we continued to grow the number of people using Forecaster and remember, we built the initial client. So we were kind of able to onboard people and give them an app that they could be using. People started tinkering around with things. So Greg Skriloff built something called Searchcaster. Shaki Sukar built something called Cast RSS, which turns any Forecaster feed into an RSS feed, which you can consume in a feed reader. And we just started to get people playing around with things, which when you have people permissionless, innovating and then sharing on Forecaster, and we try to do a job of.

# Farcaster ｜ Building a Sufficiently Decentralized Social Network with Dan Romero, Co-founder. [zAaKwu-G4DM]_part3

sharing it to everyone else, because it's relevant for people using it, it just starts to create some momentum where now other people are like, oh, interesting, this is something, if I'm spending time on Farcaster, this is a way I can actually kind of do something fun, but also get some status on this network, because this network is about like actually building on top of what's available. And so we've had a huge increase in the amount of developer activity over the last six to nine months. And we think it is going to hopefully increase even more once hubs are up. So these are all people who are trusting everything that I'm saying, which I'm appreciative that they are, but I don't think that that is good enough to be a protocol, like you need to hit some level of just don't, you know, trust the code, trust the ability for you to actually be completely sovereign without having to talk to anyone. And so where we are putting a lot of effort is to get hubs out. But then once hubs are out, I think we probably will shift towards maybe doing a little bit better job of documenting how to build things on Farcaster, giving people ideas, open source libraries that make it easier to do that. But I think doing all that now would just kind of be like, okay, yeah, you're getting more developer activity, but you're getting developer activity before you've actually done the hard thing of like showing that the system can actually work in a permissionless and decentralized way. That's good. So as we start turning the corner here, did we miss anything here? Is there anything we should talk about Farcaster? Anything about like what you're building now? Anything about like what you're really excited about in the next couple of weeks or a couple of months? Well, I've already talked about hubs. I think the one other thing that people bring up on decentralized social media, which I think is a reasonable point is how do you do content moderation? And my answer to them is, how do we do content moderation on the email protocol today? And then the second question would be, how do you do content moderation on the web? So to go through each of those examples on the email network, content moderation is done at the client level, right? So for those at home, client is kind of like the app that you use to access a protocol. So if you're using Gmail as your Gmail email address provider, that's your email client. And what's interesting about email is you can actually use one service for the like cloud-based stuff. So you can use Gmail where like your email lives in the cloud, but you don't necessarily have to use the Gmail app. There's another thing called IMAP, which is another protocol that allows you to use maybe the default mail client on an iPhone and connect in or Microsoft Outlook can connect into Gmail. So email is actually, you know, kind of like a lot of client choice. But how do you prevent bad actors from sending you email is we have spam filters. And so spam filters aren't a globally administered, there isn't a room where people are deciding what is spam versus not. It's done at a client level. Yes, they probably share, you know, block lists and things like that between the big providers, but ultimately Gmail's spam policy can be different than Microsoft's. That's a market-based decision. The web is a little different in that if you think about a browser, browser doesn't do any content moderation. I can go to basically any URL that's sent to me with the exception of the SSL certificate is out of whack. Chrome or Safari gets pretty aggressive and says, don't go to this web page, but you can still actually a lot of times click the advanced button and then still proceed. So web browsers actually have a lot more freedom in terms of like what you're able to access. And I think any reasonable person is not holding a web browser liable that if you end up on some website that whether it has hate speech or illegal content or whatever, the browser is not the issue here. It's actually the server that's hosting that website. And so the way this all works on the internet or like, you know, the web is most people use Google to navigate the web, right? Or a search engine and search engine makes no guarantee that they're going to index your page. In fact, they can de-index you and then there is no arbitration. You can't go to court. It's centralized in the sense that they can make those decisions based on what they think is the right user experience and following the rules in the country that they're in. But what's important is even though Google has what 90% market share, you know, they claim 60, but whatever, it's a massive amount of market share in search. You can use Bing, you can use DuckDuckGo, maybe ChatGPT will have a search engine later this year. Like, so that market is competitive in the sense that if Google got too crazy moderating, like by taking too many websites out of its index, people would switch to something different, right? So they have a natural check and balance on what's in their index. And, but the important thing though, is if they de-index you, you basically get no distribution. Yeah, you can share a link to your email subscriber list. But if you, you know, you have something where, I don't know, you have a website on the COVID vaccine and you want to get that information out there, even if a whole bunch of people link to you all over the internet, and that normally would make you rank high on Google if Google de-indexes you, just you don't exist. And so you're not going to get the traffic there. And so that people think is reasonable. It's like, well, Google can do that. So same thing happens with Farcaster, just like Spam or just like a Google search index, clients are going to decide what their content moderation policies are. So in the case of our client, we're a US-based company. We have regulations that we have to follow section 230, DMCA. So, you know, IP related stuff, but we also have the first amendment. So there is actually a balance there. And so I think for us, we're going to follow the letter of the law in the US. We're going to be transparent about it. But what's key is maybe those rules don't apply to someone who lives in France or someone who lives in Nigeria. And if someone wants to use a client that's respecting the rules in that country or use the protocol, they're free to do that. And I think that works on Ethereum. It works on the web where you actually have the freedom of choice of what client and what set of rules you want to play by. I think that Farcaster, as a protocol, would probably spend a lot more time being kind of focused on anti-spam, anti-anything that's like trying to harm the performance of the network. And the clients will do the work on is this content legal? Should this content get boosted in algorithm, etc.? But that will be much similar to email or search engine than what we traditionally think of social media, which I think the challenge with traditional social media and content moderation is your identity is bundled there with the posts, with the algorithm, with all of the distribution and engagement. And so you can't break apart pieces and say, OK, well, we're not going to host this content, but people can still interact with it. And actually, Macedon has a similar thing, by the way, where you can actually have other servers ban your server, which is interesting because if you're using a Macedon client and you're connecting into your Macedon server, you actually, even though the client might actually allow you to see content, your server where your identity is tied to might have a set of rules that's different. So I actually don't think that that gives much consumer choice. And so I think I want to get to a place where the content is separated from the client and you choose to host it. I want to get to a place where the content is separated from the client and you choose the client that works best for you. And the clients are also going to choose the level of risk tolerance that they want. And I actually fully expect most large clients in the forecaster network will have as much content moderation, maybe even in cases more than traditional social networks, because the important thing is that you're not censoring people. What you're just saying is, if you don't want to have content in our client, go somewhere else. And last point I'll give here is we lived with this at Coinbase. So Coinbase has something called a MAC, a mandatory account closure. You have to close an account because they're suspected of doing something illegal or fraudulent or just don't want to be a customer anymore. By the way, banks have this as well. When we did a MAC for a customer that had 10 Bitcoin with us, we don't keep the Bitcoin. We say, OK, sorry, we're no longer wanting to do business with you. Please tell us where to sign a Bitcoin. That's it. And like that, to me, is a much more reasonable approach to saying, we don't want to do business with you. That's fine. But we're not censoring you. We're not disappearing you off the Internet. We're not taking your audience away. That should be left to, in my opinion, the true legality of where the Web's content is hosted. And if that person is actually doing things that are illegal, it's going to catch up with them at some point. And I think that that is a healthier ecosystem because then you don't have some one company and one team trying to decide what is truth or what is good or bad. It's no, we have our set of policies and we have our set of rules and this is the way it works. We ask of all of our guests, because we have a diverse audience that's seeking to learn and as we say, go from crypto curious to crypto native. So we always like to learn what is it that inspired you, that motivated you early on in your crypto career? Was it something you read, someone, a blog on Twitter, for instance? What was that? I think the initial inspiration for me working in tech is I kind of fell in love with blogs on the Internet and I just thought it was so cool that for not a lot of money and not a lot of effort, you could be online and start publishing. And if people found your stuff interesting, you could grow an audience, right? There's no gatekeeper effectively. And so I've always kind of been really into that. I think Paul Graham's essays were pretty influential as well. I think about them a lot. I never did YC, my co-founder Varun actually had a company in YC prior to working at Coinbase. But I think as an entrepreneur, I kind of run through a lot of these challenges on a regular basis and I find myself going back to kind of these little truisms that Paul Graham has, do things that don't scale. Find 100 users that love your product rather than 10,000 users or 100,000 users that like your product. And I think the ethos of what PG has put online and the kind of like what YC, especially in the early days, stood for this idea that like, no, there should be more people trying to build new things in the world, like ambitious new things. I think it's been like something that I've been really into probably since I was in high school. And so that's kind of both in working at Coinbase, which was exciting, but then in starting Farcaster, I think I'm just generally inspired to, I don't know, put a dent in the universe and work on something that I believe in the long run kind of enables forward progress, right? Like civilizational progress. And that's a wrap. If you'd like to learn more about Dan Romero and Farcaster, you can follow them on Twitter at DWR and Farcaster underscore XYZ, respectively.

# Farcaster：  Introduction [vMWjol6xHJ0]

All right, I want to start off by setting up the four problems that we're trying to solve with Barcaster. So let's begin by defining a social network with our protagonists, Alice, Bob, Claire, and David. Now, a social network is one where people can send different kinds of messages to each other. And they might be text messages like, hello world. They might be images like image.png that different people are sending, or different types of media. These things can also be actions, like Claire likes Alice's post, for example. And every social network you can think of can basically be reduced to a set of users and actions that they perform on other users. Snapchat is effectively a network where the images are ephemeral. They last only for a certain amount of time. And they're permissions so that only a specific set of people can see them. Now, with a decentralized social network, we'll add one constraint on top of this model. We'll say that a decentralized social network is one where people can also use different applications to actually talk to each other. So Alice, for example, might use Snapface, a popular social networking client, while Claire and David might actually end up using FacePro 2000, a different and more advanced social networking client. And the important thing is that all of these users can communicate with each other irrespective of the apps that they're using. Now, the problems that we face when dealing with decentralized social network is the first one is a problem of identity. So an identity in a social network is often a unique identifier, like a username or an ID number, like at Alice, for example, along with a bunch of non-unique stuff. So this might be a display name, a profile picture, a verification checkmark. And this whole bundle of stuff, when it shows up on someone's profile, is how you recognize that they are the Alice that you think they're supposed to be. Now, in a decentralized social network, you need to be able to claim an identity in a way such that no one else controls this identity. So it's important that Alice is able to sort of jump between Snapface and FacePro and continue using her same identity of Alice, which means that Snapface itself doesn't control this identity. Alice is the only one that controls this. So decentralized social networks must be able to issue decentralized identities as well that map to real-world entities. The second problem that we face is one of authentication, which is that when Alice creates a message, it's important that everybody can trust that this message, hello world, came from her. So if Claire or David received this message, for example, they need to be able to authenticate the message because it comes through a bunch of untrusted parties along the way. And they need to know that none of them have tampered with this message as it's been in flight. And so that's a very important property when you have hundreds or thousands of different services and applications all handling and passing messages back and forth between each other. The third problem you run into is one that we call availability. So in a social network, you can imagine that there are millions of users creating lots and lots of posts. And let's say someone else wants to launch a new social network, a social networking application. So they want to launch a new app over here and connect to the network. Now, it's very important that this application can guarantee that if Alice jumps over here, she's still able to see all of these different messages that have been generated on other social networks. That is, the data is always available no matter what applications she switches to. If a new app wasn't able to guarantee this, Alice wouldn't switch, and the network would become less decentralized as a result. And there's a fundamental tension here, because if users can generate an infinite number of messages, let's say David generates a billion messages, then Alice or this new application can't realistically index all of this stuff. And so availability requires making sure that the data can move quickly between applications, but also ensuring that there are reasonable constraints on the size and volume of that data changing so that the network can actually become reasonably available. And the last problem we'll call as one of consistency, which is social networks have certain rules. So for example, our social network might say that every user can like a post only once. And so what happens if Claire on her application actually sets up two different messages that say that she likes Alice's post at two different times? This creates a problem, because Alice using Snapface might decide that the first one is valid and use this timestamp, whereas Bob using a different client might actually say that the last one is the valid timestamp. And so when using these different networks, these two users get a different view of what happened, because each of their applications has had to make independent decisions on enforcing the rules of the network. And this is not ideal, because it leads to divergent state. So we also want a network that can enforce certain rules of consistency and make sure that everybody agrees on the same message and discards earlier messages. And it discards conflicting messages. So these are the four core problems, identity, authentication, availability, and consistency. And we'll talk in future videos about how Farcaster solves these particular problems.

# Farcaster： Account Recovery [DnAG4mXlOFI]

So a challenge with decentralized social networks is what happens if the user loses their key pair. Let's say Alice misplaces the public-private key pair that controls 1234, which also controls her ID 3489. Now she can no longer send messages on behalf of her ID. And obviously this is problematic. In centralized social networks, there's usually an email recovery flow you can go through, but in decentralized social networks, we need a similar system to protect Alice without compromising the decentralized ownership of her identity. So the one way we accomplish this is by allowing a secondary recovery identity to be set up by Alice. So when Alice first sets up her account, or at any point after, she can nominate a second address called a recovery address that also is connected to the same identity. So now we'll connect this here, and we'll say that this one, she actually nominates Bob's address, 9889, which is now her recovery address. So a primary address, or this custody address over here, has a special property where it can transfer this identity to a new address. So let's say that Alice, for whatever reason, wants to rotate her key pair. She wants to use a new application. She can simply go and issue a transfer request, which moves this down here to 5678 and nullifies the ID that was previously assigned to 1234. This still has to obey the rules that each address can have exactly one ID, at most one ID at any time, and an ID can also be mapped only to one address. As long as those rules are held, a transfer can be executed at any time on the blockchain. Now, the recovery address, the way the recovery system works, is that we allow the recovery system to request a transfer of the address, and after seven days, it can complete that request to another identity, to another address. So let's say that Alice has lost her key pair 1234. She goes to Bob and says, hey, Bob, I've lost my key pair. Can you transfer this? So what Bob does is Bob, you know, let's say it's January 1st. Bob issues a transfer request, which is recorded onto the blockchain, and this request says that Bob wants to move this ID 3489 to 5678, which Alice also controls. But the ID actually doesn't move over yet. It kind of stays there. Now, after seven days have passed, Bob can come along and complete the transfer with a separate transaction, which is enforced by the blockchain, and at this point, the ID transfers over, and the ID swap and 5678 is now the owner of this identity. The delay period here is super important because it allows us to be protected against the situation where Bob goes hostile. So let's say that Alice actually did have control over her ID and Bob attempted to maliciously transfer her identity away from her. Well, Alice can just at any point in between these two dates, Alice can issue a transfer cancellation, which immediately stops and cancels this request, and it would just delete this entirely. And she can also then go and revoke Bob's identifier and so on, and then make it so that Bob can no longer have any access to her identity. So this is sort of an important property of the system, right? The recovery address has the ability to move the identity after a delay or an escrow period, which prevents it from having total control over the identity. It only has control of the identity in the absence of the primary custodian of the identity or if the custodian doesn't respond. And there's the seven day waiting period that ensures that the custodian has sufficient time to respond to any requests if they're still in control of their identity. And so this is actually a really cool system that can be composed in a bunch of different ways. So we've said here that Alice gives control of this to Bob, but it doesn't have to be Bob. It could actually be her second wallet that she actually keeps in a safe somewhere. It could actually be a third party service that would do something like call her and verify her identity or check her driver's license before giving her back her account. And so you can actually compose this in a bunch of interesting ways to create different recovery systems based on what each user wants. Now, a final note, there is a bunch of research going on in the systems like account abstraction on Ethereum that would actually allow even more composability where people can customize how their own recovery system works. And you don't need this recovery system implemented in a central registry. But for now, while those systems are still being developed, the Farcaster ID registry has its own recovery system, which give people the flexibility of setting up their recovery. And Farcaster clients will be encouraged to help users set up a recovery system by default so they never end up in a situation where their identity is lost forever.

# Farcaster： Authentication [ZzySey1azWM]

We've talked about how users can register farcaster IDs. In this case, Alice, who controls the address 0x1234, has registered the farcaster ID 3489. She now includes this ID in her messages to Bob. Now, we also need a way for this message to be authenticated. That is, when Bob gets the message, he needs to know that it came from Alice, even if it was relayed to him through another server. One simple way we can do this is by taking advantage of the fact that Ethereum addresses are effectively public and private key pairs that can be used to produce cryptographic signatures. We can have Alice sign this message with a packet. She simply takes the message and produces a signature using a private key that she has. We know that Alice must have a private key that corresponds to the address 0x1234, and she can simply use that private key to produce a signature, which she includes in the message. When Bob receives this message, all Bob has to do is take the author ID or the FID, look it up on the blockchain, find the corresponding public key or address in this case, and then check if the signature was produced by that address. Since only the person who controls the private key can produce that signature, Bob knows that this message must have come from the same person that registered this ID on the blockchain. This is a fairly straightforward authentication system. It's very simple. It uses cryptographic primitives that we're familiar with, and it's tamper-proof. This message can bounce through any number of untrusted servers and nobody can actually modify the message without also invalidating the signature. There is a slight problem with this approach though. Now, let's imagine that Alice actually has applications that she uses to browse the Forecaster Network. Maybe she has a phone that she uses from time to time. Now, one problem with this approach is that Alice needs to take this private key and actually load it on this device while using the application so that the app can actually produce the signature over here. This creates a bit of a problem because in many cases, the app that you're using might be a third-party application. It might not necessarily be something that you want to trust with your identity, because if the app is untrustworthy, it could actually steal your public and private key and actually steal your identity and then pretend to be Alice from now on. You can also imagine that Alice may be using multiple applications at once. So she wants a way to allow the application to publish messages on her behalf, which is fine because messages can be deleted even if the app goes rogue. But she doesn't necessarily want the applications to have full control over her identity. One way we approach this is we don't let the apps actually take what we call the custody key or the key that controls your identity. We actually have each application generate a separate key pair that we call a signer. This signer looks like this and it's generated on the device itself. What we actually have Alice do rather than produce the signature is we have Alice create another message called a signer message which includes this following content. So first it has the custody address or Alice's address 1234. Then it has a signer address. Let's say that this is 0x5678. Finally, it contains a signature from the custody address. Now let's see how these connect up here. The custody address is simply this address. It's what Alice originally has the key for. The signer address or this one over here is the new key pair generated by the phone. The signature is produced by the custody address or this address. Alice is effectively setting up a chain of trust from her custody address, which creates the signature, to the new signer address on this phone, telling the world that she's okay with this signer now creating messages on her behalf. Now we can have this signer actually produce this signature down on this message over here, and we've created a chain of trust linking this ID to this key pair, which Alice controls, to this message, which authorizes a key pair on her phone, to this message, which then gets delivered to Bob. Now Bob can simply, as long as Bob has access to both of these messages, Bob can simply walk through this chain of trust and establish that this message actually came from Alice. This is a very simple cryptographic system that allows a user to establish a chain of trust going from a forecaster ID, which is in a contract on the blockchain, all the way down to messages that are getting delivered to users. Now there's a couple of things to touch on here. One is, there's two components to our system. The area above the line over here exists on the Ethereum blockchain and establishes the forecaster IDs and keys, while the area down here works outside of the blockchain and is largely a sequence of messages that chain from this ID registry all the way down to actions taken by the user. We haven't yet talked about how these messages work or where exactly they're stored, and that's going to be the subject of our future videos, where we explore how this area under the line or the layer 2 works.

# Farcaster： Break In Recovery [DB6q_IGSaKI]

Today's topic is break-in recovery, or specifically, how we can stop an attacker who learns K1 from being able to determine what K2, K3, and K4 are. The problem is that this KDF, or key derivation function between each of these steps, is deterministic and has the same input. So because we're always providing the same input, you can always keep determining this indefinitely, once you figure out one of these values. Fortunately, the KDF also accepts a second input, which can be used to change this value, deterministically. So if I send in a value X, this becomes a different K1. If I send in a value Y, this becomes a different K1. If we can get Alice and Bob to get another shared secret that changes at every step, we can have them put this into this value. And as long as we keep this value here secret from the attacker, we can move the chain forward, and an attacker who compromises K1 will only be able to determine M1, or one of the message keys, and will not be able to determine successive keys. They would have to break that secret value every time, which makes us much more resilient. Now luckily, we have a pretty good way for Alice and Bob to determine shared secrets. We already did this right up here. We used the private and public keys to determine the initial secret value K, which was used to seed this. So we can just kind of repeat this process for every step. So what we do is we have Alice set up a new key pair, and we also ask Bob to do the same over here. So Bob sets up another public and private key pair, and assume that Alice and Bob exchange their public keys. And they're both aware of this. Now to derive this first K1, Alice takes Bob's public key A as an input, and Alice takes her private key as an input. And she first does this process, the Diffie-Hellman, to produce a shared secret, and then feeds that as the input value into this algorithm. Now since Bob knows Alice's public key, and Bob also has his private key, he can perform the exact same step on the other side, getting the exact same shared secret. And so Alice and Bob can feed this shared secret in, and so a person who gets one value is not going to be able to know the next value, because they would also need to break this private key, which is securely generated on Alice and Bob's side. So that adds a layer of protection. And you can have Alice and Bob regenerate these keys for every step, and you can have them share the public key along with the message. So the idea is that you don't need a separate communication channel. You can just send the new public key along with your next message, and then Bob can use it and send a public key back. And you kind of go back and forth. And every time you have this new value going in, creating new secure message keys. Now there's a problem with this approach, which is it assumes that messages ping pong nicely. Alice sends a message, Bob sends a message back, et cetera, et cetera. But what happens if Bob sends two messages and Alice also simultaneously sends two messages? This creates a situation where these messages end up using the same key pair, and there becomes a... There enters some confusion around which message was encrypted with which key pair, because they don't always progress linearly like this. So to solve this, we introduce the notion of separate sending and receiving key pairs. We actually say that Alice has a key pair, or sorry, KDF, or key chain to encrypt her messages, and Bob has a key chain to encrypt his messages, and they're both aware of each other's chains. So we introduce a new chain over here, and we'll color code this differently so that we can tell these two apart. And what we do is we'll go ahead and make some modifications to this diagram over here to make this a little cleaner. We'll say that this only has one key generated so far, and that this has one key generated over here so far. So cool. So what Alice has done over here is Alice has generated the first key using her sending chain and sent it over to Bob. Now Bob's also aware of Alice's sending chain, which works out pretty well, so Bob is also able to derive the second key pair. Now when Bob wants to send out his message, Bob doesn't actually use the same key pair as we did before. Bob actually uses this other chain, which is over here, which is Bob's receiving chain... Or Bob's sending chain and Alice's receiving chain in order to generate the new key pair. And the nice property about this is if Bob were to send out another message, he could just go ahead and derive a new key from this, and this would work nicely, and you would get a deterministic key three. And if Alice were to do the same, you would sort of be able to get a new key over here that derived from this chain, and this would move forward. So Alice and Bob can now send a bunch of messages back and forth. Alice can send three or four messages, and they would all increment on this chain. Bob can send messages, and they would increment on this chain. And you wouldn't have this situation where messages on both sides got encrypted by the same key. Now the one thing about this is this sort of becomes tedious, right? You have to maintain separate public and private keys for this chain. You have to initialize this secret using a separate public key pair. So that kind of gets duplicate copies of everything, which is just a little painful to maintain. So in the next video, we'll discuss some systems to simplify this and make this a little easier.

# Farcaster： Delta Graphs [JcO9UA2R6JY]

We've previously talked about how we use messages to represent actions taken by users on a social network and that hubs just store and share these messages between each other. Today I want to get a little bit more specific about how exactly messages are stored and shared between hubs. We're going to introduce a new concept called the Delta Graph. So we'll define a delta as something that a user can do on a social network. It could be as something as simple as Alice says, Hello world! Which is a type of delta known as a cast, where you're broadcasting something into the world. It could also be something along the lines of Bob likes Hello World, which is a reaction or a response to something that someone else has already done. It could also be something like a share or as we call them recasts, where Bob shares the message Hello World to people that are subscribed to him. There's also other types of more complex interactions where Bob might actually reply, Welcome to Hello World! So he's actually saying something but is connecting it to another piece of data on the network. And so you can sort of see how a simple set of instructions, you know, reactions, replies, messages, etc. can be used to compose most common social actions that people do. But one of the interesting things that happens is when people create deltas that conflict with each other. So for example, let's say that Bob at a later date decides to unlike this message. So now we have sort of a Bob likes Hello World. If a hub was simply a collection of deltas like this, we now have a problem. When a developer sees this data, the developer sees two conflicting messages. It says here that Bob likes Hello World and Bob unlikes Hello World. And obviously both of them can't be true at the same time. And so we need a way to actually resolve this conflict and figure out what the current state of the network is. And it's important that hubs actually handle this so that developers get a consistent view of the social network. And so, you know, one developer doesn't decide that the like is the current state and the other developer doesn't decide that the unlike is the current state. Everyone needs to come to consensus on what the current state is when such conflicts exist. And so the other rule that we say is that the set of deltas must be combined using a set of rules to produce a valid social graph. Now, a graph is a very simple data structure that have vertices which represent content on the network. So in this case, something like Alice is actually a vertex and so is Bob. But vertices can also be used to represent content. So when Alice writes something, she's actually creating a new vertex for the world, but is also creating an edge or a relationship to that message, claiming that she's the parent of that message. So we can see that this delta over here produces this hello world and this line that connects this to it. And similarly, when Bob likes hello world and when Bob reacts to hello world, a recast hello world, he produces two additional messages of that sort as well, where this is a like relationship and the other one is a recast. Now, you can also visualize the reply in this sort of way, right, where you can go ahead and say that the reply welcome here is actually has the parent relationship to Bob and then also has a reply relationship to hello world. So this is sort of a more complex action that has introduced multiple edges and a single vertex. Now, it's clear that unlike, like and this sort of node over here all collide, right, because one of the rules of our social graph says that, hey, any two, a user and a piece of content may only have one relationship of a particular type. And so that that relationship can be either that the like is true or that the like is false, but it can't simultaneously be both unlike and like. And so hubs actually do a transformation. They actually do this sort of combine or merge function that takes a set of deltas, analyzes them and produces a valid social graph. And when it detects a conflict like this, it actually has a set of rules that can take these two messages and determine a single winner. So it might actually say that, hey, you know, the like is the older message. Let's get rid of it. And we actually know that unlike is the current state of the network. And it can do this in a way without needing consensus, without having to talk to any other hubs. All of the data needed to make this decision and reach consensus exists within the hub itself. And so this has a very, very nice property, right? If you go back and imagine that there's two different hubs that both have these messages, but each has a different sort of copy of the messages or each has a different set of messages, let's say. So this one doesn't have this one and this one doesn't have these two messages. A simple way that hubs can come into consensus is if they just swap their sets of messages and they both apply the same merge function. It's guaranteed to now produce the exact same social graph. So two hubs that have each gotten messages from different users just share all of these deltas together and then apply the merge function on the delta and the merge function guarantees that they always produce the same social graph. And this allows each hub to have the same representation that developers can call and pull and so on. Now, the merge function is sort of a lot of special magic, and we'll dive into that in a follow up video where we talk about how exactly this works and what are the different deltas and how they all interact with each other.

# Farcaster： Delta Types [W0-pvgyQhaM]

Now that we've talked about how deltas are merged and how the delta graph is produced, I want to talk about the different types of deltas that users can create on a system. So one of the deltas that users can create, we've already talked about, is the notion of casts or public broadcasts of text that are visible to everybody on the network. Another type, and we also discussed this previously, is the reaction type, where you can react to a cast or even a non-cast object like a web page or something else. And reactions have different flavors, so you can have likes, you can have recasts, and we may add more types in the future, but they effectively represent a relationship between a person and an object. We also have what we call amps. So amps are endorsements of one user by another user, where you can sort of boost another user to people who are subscribed or following you on the network. And we also have verifications. So verifications are proofs of ownership. So it's effectively a two-way signed message. So you sign it one directionally from, for example, your Ethereum wallet and another direction from your Forecaster wallet, and it proves that these two are connected together. And so this is how you can link different wallets and get your NFTs to show up in Forecaster and things like that. We also have user data. So this is metadata about the user. You can think of this as like your biofield, your profile picture, and all of the stuff that builds up your profile. And there's a narrow set of predefined things that you can add over here. And finally, we have what we call signers. We've talked about this before when we talked about authentication, where signers are sort of a silent data type. They're the very first one you establish to establish a new signing key pair. And then you sign all the other messages with the signers that you previously established. So they're sort of special in that you've got to set up a signer first, and then you can go create these messages. Now one interesting thing that we talked about in reactions, how you can have likes and unlikes, and you can change the state of reactions. But for some of these data types, you may actually want to delete something permanently. So let's take a cast, for example, where you've said, hello world. And this had a hash of some sort and a timestamp. And you no longer want this message, and you want to get rid of it. This is a common feature in a social network. For a variety of reasons, you may disagree with something you said previously you no longer wanted on your page, and you may want to get rid of it. It's not a permanent purge. Obviously in a public social network, unlike Twitter, anyone can take a screenshot of your post. And on Farcaster, anyone can copy your message with your signature and proof that you've said it later. But it's sort of a temporary, like, get this out of my profile. I no longer want it there. And the way we do deletes on Farcaster is we introduce a special type of message called delete message. So some deltas are add messages, where you can actually add a new message, like so. And others are delete messages, which actually remove previous content. So the delete message doesn't actually contain the message itself. It rather just contains a reference to the hash of the message. So it just says, remove this message. And it has its own hash, which is obviously going to be distinct. So we'll call this something else. And it also has a timestamp, which usually is going to end up being later than when the message was created. And so when a hub sees a remove message, it actually discards the add message and holds onto the remove message. And if anyone tries to put the add message back on the hub, the hub can kind of compare this hash with this hash and say, oh, no, I already got a command to remove this. I'm not accepting it, and can just reject future messages. So this allows us to encode the notion of delete in the system, but also a type of delete that eradicates the content of the original message and no longer preserves it on the hub. Now, you can sort of model hubs using this little diagram that I made over here, where you can think of each hub as having a set of boxes, each of which stores one particular data type. So as Alice creates casts, they kind of go into this box over here. As she creates reactions, they go into this box over here, and so on. And all users' messages kind of get aggregated. And you see little messages in either added states, where they're added and taken to the network, or in replaced states, when they have been deleted from the network. And the boxes, you can think of them as implementing the merge functions that we discussed earlier. So they're not going to contain all of the messages that were created, but they're only going to contain the set of deltas necessary to produce a valid graph, meaning that as a delete message comes in, the older add message might get discarded because it's no longer relevant. And so it's a very efficient representation of the data. So if you like something, unlike something, like something, unlike something, like something, sort of keep toggling it, it'll only keep the most recent message, and all the older ones can be discarded to save space. And this is a very efficient data structure for storing network data on the hubs. Now if you're familiar with computer science-y terms, one way to think about this little box over here is this is a CRDT, or a conflict-free replicated data type, which means that as the messages get merged into the set, all the conflicts can be resolved locally. And this has a bunch of useful properties that we'll get to when we talk about sync later on in the video series. Cool, that's all for now.

# Farcaster： Direct Casts [T9p9OCJQTYI]

We've been thinking about how to support direct messaging, or as we call it, direct casting, on the Farkaster protocol to augment the public nature of messaging on Farkaster today. So today, Alice and Bob can send public messages to each other, but it would be really nice if Alice and Bob can send direct casts of private messages between each other so that they can take a public conversation and extend it into a private conversation between the two of them. And it's sort of useful to jump between these modalities as you're using the social network. So we've been putting a little thought into how we'd like to build this, and I wanted to walk you through some of our thinking today. So in order for a direct messaging product to be useful, we actually needed to achieve a few different goals. The first is that it would need to be secure. So if Alice sends a message out, she knows that Bob and only Bob can read that message. The second is it would need to be reliable, so that if Alice sends out a message, she has a high degree of confidence that Bob is able to receive and read the message that she sent to him. And the third is it needs to be useful. So a base case of being useful, which we'll launch the product with, is being able to send a direct message between two people. But you can imagine that there's a lot more that goes into making the client actually useful. For example, you might want links that you said to be auto-expanded. You might want to get read receipts. You might want reactions to messages. You might want to be able to have people do groups and have group messages. And there's a long list of features that actually go into making a messaging client very useful to people beyond just, I can send bits of text between people. And finally, you also want the client to be open. And open here means that users on different Farcaster clients are going to actually be able to message each other irrespective of which Farcaster client they're using. So it actually creates a really powerful network that anyone can plug into. Now these goals, while very desirable, are difficult to achieve all at once. And in fact, there's no implementation out there today that achieves all of this at once. And part of the problem is that some of these goals actually make the other goals harder. While you can kind of go and fairly in a straightforward way, build a very open messaging protocol or a very secure messaging protocol, it's actually hard to build one that is, for example, both open and secure. And a simple reason why is security is often guaranteed by the client. So your app on your phone is what does all of the encryption and handles the messaging. But if you say that it's open and anyone can build an app and your message could be read by any other application, there's an implicit trust of the cryptography that that application is performing. And you can't guarantee that messages that Alice sends will only be readable by Bob if Bob actually uses a very insecure client that's leaking a lot of data, either intentionally or accidentally. And so the way we want to approach this is to bite off the problem bit by bit and build towards a good solution. So we're going to start kind of from the top over here. Let me actually make this a single-ended arrow. So we want to start by initially making it secure. And I think we've laid a good foundation for this today. And we're working on making this super reliable. So we want to make sure that when you send a message, you have a high degree of confidence that the message is going to be received. And we're going to spend a good chunk of our time over the next few months working on these two portions. Over time, you'll see us expand into useful and open areas where we actually work on extending the feature set and adding more and more things and start working on ways in which we can make it so that different users on different clients can all communicate with each other. And this hopefully provides a framework to show you how we're thinking about developing this over time. So early on, the Farcaster messaging protocol or the Direct Cast protocol is going to be secure and reliable, but not necessarily open. And what that means is we're actually going to build it within the Merkle client to start. So as you know, there are many Farcaster clients. You end up at Merkle, Discov, Purple, and many, many more. But the initial implementation of this, which is focused on security and reliability, is going to work primarily on Merkle. Merkle is going to do the first implementation of this to get this to a place where it's stable. And then we'll start prototyping ways to make it work with other clients. So if Alice and Bob are using Merkle clients on day one, they're going to be able to message each other and communicate with each other using direct messages. But if they log into Discov, for example, that's not going to be able to open their messages. Now, Discov can implement its own messaging system. But over time, what we want to do is actually make it so that the protocol is open. And once this is a little more established, we'll kind of make it so that even if the user is using Discov, they're going to be able to communicate with a client that is on Merkle today. And that will actually make the whole protocol open. So hopefully that gives you an overview of how we're approaching the problem. Step one, secure and reliable. Step two, useful and open, and how we're expanding that over time. In future videos, I want to dig into a little bit more of the mechanics behind how we actually ensure that messages are secure and walk you through the security model and things that we established there.

# Farcaster： Double Ratchet [z91xl2RS1Do]

All right, let's see if we can simplify our system further. So we have these two key chains on each side, which is used for encrypting messages to send and decrypting messages that are received. And we don't want to go through the hassle of maintaining separate public and private keys to derive and synchronize each of these things, because that's super messy. So to solve this, we take the same diagram we had before, just clean, it's just cleaned up a little bit and spaced out so we can draw some more stuff. And we introduced the notion of a root key pair. So our root key chain. So there's a new key chain called the root, which we'll mark in blue. And we actually use the private key and public key over here to derive this one, or this root key, instead of the one for the sending chain. So Alice produces this new key pair part. And then we have it produce another root key using the same notion of a key derivation function as we had before. And we also have this produce the output, which becomes the input for the sending key chain over here. So you can kind of see that this itself is its own key derivation function. And that links back to our sending key chain over here. And so the nice thing about this is you can just think of this as sort of like nested key chains. And Bob can use the same thing over on his side to derive the key chain. So we'll move this over here, we'll delete this one, we'll have this point back to this key chain, so that we know that this is deriving this key. And again, Bob derives this root key by combining Alice's public key and Bob's own private key, which then produces the key chain. Now remember, we need some private input over here in order to ensure that there's break in recovery. And so we have Alice and Bob generate a new key pair. And again, we take Alice's private key, feed it in here, we take Bob's public key, feed it in here, and then Bob performs the same operation on his side, except it's sort of connecting the other two keys. And so we've created a nested key chain where we've used the second pair of public keys as the input to produce this stuff. Now if Alice wants to send out another message, she can just run this key derivation function for her sending key chain just one more time over. So we basically take this, we kind of link this back up here, and then we can see that Alice can just call this function again, produce another key, and send it over here. And she can just do this as many times as she wants. Now we'll remove this and go back to the one message state just to keep it a little cleaner. Now let's say that Bob wants to send a message over. What we actually have Bob do is we want Bob to move the key derivation function one step forward so that we're not using the same keys all over again, and that there's some level of break in recovery. So we have Bob generate a new public and private key, we'll then mark this over here. And what we'll do is we'll tell Bob to derive a new root key, and also to derive a new initializer for his sending chain, which will become Alice's receiving chain. So we'll put this function over here, and then we will have a new root key produced down here. And then the inputs to this function are going to be Bob's new private key, which he just generated, and Alice's old public key, which she generated over here, which is no. So this produces a new key chain, it's used to encrypt the messages, and when Bob sends over the messages, he also just includes his public key, since that just makes it convenient for Alice, and it kind of goes over here and Alice is aware of it. Now when Alice wants to move this one step further and decrypt Bob's messages, she does the same function over on this side. She uses her last root key, which is the same as Bob's key, to pass it through a KDF function, and then to obtain another key, and again she has Bob's public key and her private key, which can again be combined, sort of the inverse of this operation, to produce the same secret, which will produce the same output, which will set up Bob's sending key. So you can kind of see that there's this nice property that emerges here, where within a set of messages, let's say between these two messages, we're using the same key derivation function, so if you break into K2, you can read K3 and so on. But every time the other person sends a message across, we're using a new public and private key pair to start a new Diffie-Hellman that changes the root key, and that's something you can't break into. You can only read the messages within this chain, and as soon as there's a ping-pong, the keys get rotated, the secret's changed, and now you can no longer derive the new key, because you as the attacker are not aware of the new public or private key that Alice or Bob introduced into this equation. So this is basically what's known as the double ratchet algorithm which Signal implements. It uses these different ratchets, a sending ratchet, a receiving ratchet, and the root ratchet, and uses Diffie-Hellman to keep generating new secrets to feed into the ratchets, making sure that every time messages go back and forth, the key material is changed and the secrets are rotated, ensuring that there's both forward secrecy and break-in recovery at all steps of this. Now in a future video, we'll explore some more aspects of this and dig into the double ratchet.

# Farcaster： E2E Encryption [eMGtBmN7qKE]

Let's discuss a scheme that Alice and Bob can use to send messages to each other. Alice has a message, hello world. She wants it to send it from her phone to Bob's phone, which is usually accomplished via a server, but she doesn't want the server or anyone in this public space to be able to read the message. The message must go securely from Alice's private space over here to Bob's private space over here. Now, one way to accomplish this is by using what's called a symmetric encryption key. If Alice has a secret symmetric key, and if Bob also has the same secret symmetric key, then Alice can take her message, encrypt it using this key so that nobody in the middle can actually read this message and send it over to Bob. Once this message lands on Bob's side, if Bob has the same symmetric key, he can decrypt it and get the same hello world message. Now, we just need to establish a way for Alice and Bob to actually be able to get to a shared symmetric key. This is a bit of a problem because Alice and Bob may not be in the same physical location, they may not know each other when the conversation starts, and the server is untrusted so we can't have it handle the symmetric key. We need a way to derive this key in a secure way that it's never touched the public Internet, but Bob and Alice have this on their devices. What we do is we have Alice and Bob generate another type of key, we're called an asymmetric key. Now, an asymmetric key has two components. There's a private key, and we'll call this private key A because that's what Alice produces, and there's a public key, and we'll call this public key A, which is the public component to this key. We'll mark this green over here because this component can actually be safely uploaded to a server and shared with the world because it doesn't compromise the security of the key. The private key is the only part that needs to be kept secure. Now, Bob also similarly generates another key pair, but this is a totally different key pair. We'll call this public key B and private key B, and they have no relation to each other. There's two separate keys that were derived on each of their mobile devices. An interesting property that we can use here is that public keys and private keys can be combined using an algorithm known as the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to produce another shared value. What we actually do here is we have Alice take Bob's public key, which is public and available freely, and combine it with her private key to derive a shared value. We can actually use this value as a symmetric key, so we call this symmetric key C. Now, the cool thing is when Bob performs the inverse of this operation, but if Bob takes his private key and combines it with Alice's public key, Bob will also derive the exact same value. This actually allows Alice and Bob by creating asymmetric key pairs to actually derive a secret symmetric key pair that nobody else can ever compute unless they were aware of one of these private keys. This is a really cool piece of technology that allows Alice and Bob to land on a symmetric key, which can then be used to encrypt all of these messages between each other as we showed above. This helps us achieve end-to-end encryption. The message was always in plain text over here, gets encrypted, is always encrypted as soon as it leaves the device, and it's only decrypted on the other device, and all of these private keys have never left the device. Nobody else has an option to learn about these keys or is able to use them to break into these messages. The system does not, however, guarantee the other properties that we talked about yet. For example, there's no notion of forward secrecy, since there's only one symmetric key that's used to encrypt all the messages. If someone were to ever find out what that symmetric key was, let's say Alice accidentally leaked it from her phone, then all future and past messages would be compromised. We also haven't talked about a way for Alice and Bob to negotiate any kind of communication, any kind of recovery system so that once the key is recovered, like Alice and Bob still have to set up a new key and repeat this process all over again. We don't have break-in recovery either, which is the other important property we talked about. Finally, we still don't have metadata privacy, which is the server can still see messages going between Alice and Bob. Even though it can't read the messages, it knows, roughly speaking, that Alice and Bob are communicating with each other and can tell you how often they're talking to each other and so on. Those three properties, forward secrecy, break-in recovery, and metadata privacy, we haven't yet achieved, though we've achieved end-to-end encryption, which is super important with this scheme. We actually use this scheme in another place as well, in Farcaster outside of direct messages. If you've ever used the login with QR code feature, when you scan the QR code, what's actually happening is that your two different devices, your phone and your desktop, are actually setting up different public and private keys, and then deriving these symmetric keys, and using that to encrypt your recovery phrase or your seed phrase, and actually send that securely from one side to the other side. That's how we transport your credentials securely from one device to another device in a way that our server can never know what the contents of that device were. Cool. In future videos, we'll talk about how we add all those other interesting properties that are not yet part of the system by building on this primitive of the Diffie-Hellman exchange.

# Farcaster： Forward Secrecy [xaejrsT4KDk]

In our last video, we talked about how Alice and Bob can achieve end-to-end encryption by using an asymmetric key pair system to generate different asymmetric keys and then use that to produce a shared secret which they could use to encrypt any message that they send out. So this ensures that they both have a secret that's only known to their devices that can be used to encrypt messages before they ever leave their device, creating end-to-end encryption. Now we'd like to add some other properties to this as well. The first of one being, how do we actually know that this public key A belongs to Alice and not Charlie who's saying that he indeed is Alice? Bob needs a way to verify that this public key actually maps to the person Alice. So one way of doing this is we know that Alice has a Forcaster account with an address on the Ethereum blockchain called the custody address that actually holds the username Alice and this exists somewhere on chain. So what we have Alice do is we have her sign a message connected to this public key which is signed by this custody address that says, hey, I'm the custody address that owns Alice and I'm authorizing this public key on my behalf. So this produces a new signed message which Alice then makes publicly available and Bob fetches it along with Alice's public key and can verify the chain of ownership and knows that A does indeed belong to Alice. So it's a very simple system that is implemented for every user and once it's done, Alice and Bob both have anti-forgery properties and we know that a certain message came from one of them. Now we also want to extend our system to add the notion of forward secrecy because if this secret key that Alice and Bob generate is ever discovered, the attacker would be able to look at all past messages that Alice and Bob have exchanged and we would like that to not be possible. So to do this, we introduce the notion of a key derivation function and what we do is when we get this secret output, we previously said it was going to be used as a symmetric key, but instead of doing that, we'll actually use this as a KDF input key. And what that means is the message hello world is actually not going to be encrypted with this key and we'll kind of move this down a little bit to signify that. The KDF key is instead going to be used to populate a KDF function which generates more keys. So when the KDF function is run, we'll denote this with a little diamond over here, it will actually, using this KDF key, produce two new keys for Alice. So let's kind of draw this line over here. So one of the keys that's produced is going to be the next KDF key, so we'll call this KDF key 2. And the other key that it's going to produce is a message key which we'll call M key over here, or we'll call this M key 1 to keep this simple. And so what we're seeing happen over here is that two new keys are being produced every time the key derivation function is run, and if you have this key, if you have KDF key 1, you can get to KDF key 2, and if you have 2, you can produce 3 and so on. But if you have 2, you can't go backwards to 1. And what we do now that we have these two keys is we use this message key, or M key over here, to actually encrypt the message hello world, which is then sent across to BOP. So we send this message over here in encrypted format, BOP receives the message, and BOP runs the exact same process on the other side. So BOP is able to use his KDF key 1 to derive the same KDF key 2 in the message key 1, and BOP can then use this message key to decrypt this message and read that it says hello world. And Alice and BOP can kind of keep this going in a ping pong fashion, right? Now BOP wants to send another message back to Alice saying hi Alice, so he puts KDF 2 into a function, and this would give him KDF key 3 and message key 2, which are derived from this, and he uses it to encrypt the message hi Alice. Again this becomes an encrypted blob over here, and then Alice runs the same function again to generate the exact same messages. Alice now has KDF key 3 and message key 2, and Alice can use message key 2 to decrypt this new message that actually says hi Alice, we'll kind of drive from over here. And Alice is now able to decrypt this message. And so you can kind of see how Alice and BOP are able to keep extending the single key into multiple keys, each of which can be used to encrypt a message. And this has some nice properties. If you were to break message key 1, for example, all that you could do is decrypt this particular message and know that Alice said hello world, but you're not going to be able to decrypt other messages. If you had KDF key 2, or let's say KDF key 3 in this case, you're not going to be able to go back and figure out the message key 1 or KDF key 2 to decrypt this message. You are going to be able to break future messages, so you can use this for example to generate KDF key 4 and 5 and 6, but you can't go backwards and figure out what messages Alice and BOP have been exchanging. So the addition of this KDF key and using the secret to generate more secrets with a hash function lets us generate new keys for every message in a way that Alice and BOP both have them, giving us forward secrecy to our system.

# Farcaster： Merging Deltas [QtAS4PkrGOc]

So we previously talked about how a merge function could take a series of deltas from a user and even if they conflict with each other combine them to produce the same result. Now let's look at that with a specific example in this case a like message or a reaction. So let's assume that Alice has created a message and Bob likes Alice's message. So first off for each message we'll define what we call a conflict ID which sort of defines a unique object in the graph being modified. So in this case it's Bob, hello world, and like. And we also define another thing which is a state in this case we're sort of setting it to true and so the conflict ID and the state kind of combined together produce the delta message. Now one challenge is what happens if Bob accidentally creates two messages and sends them to the forecaster. So you kind of see two messages that have the same content you don't want them to increment the number of likes that Alice gets twice. So what we do here is we actually introduce a unique ID in the form of a hash. So we simply take the contents of the message and we hash them and as long as the contents haven't changed the hash is guaranteed to be unique. So in this case we'll end up with a hash like this and it turns out that this message since it has the exact same content has the exact same hash. And so that provides a very simple way for Hub to say hey I already know about this message I'm not going to update my state let's just ignore this one for now. And so duplicate messages are handled in a very easy way. Now what happens when the state change actually conflicts? In this case let's say that Bob actually unliked the message so the state is now false and let's also say that well the hash also changes right so instead of 213 you might sort of have like 245 something something something. And so in this case the Hub can't just rely on the technique that it used before because obviously the two hashes are not similar. So what the Hub does instead is it relies on another user reported property which is the timestamp. So users are allowed to sort of specify an ordering for those messages by providing a timestamp so the users can kind of indicate hey I want this message to be created after this message and this provides a very easy conflict resolution scheme right we can sort of say that hey we got these two messages ones after the other they both conflict so let's just keep this one and move on. Now the challenge in distributed systems is that time is often unreliable and you know users might accidentally or intentionally send the same timestamp for the same messages and that kind of creates a little bit of confusion over here right so if we get both of these messages they have different hashes but the same timestamp we now have to make a decision on what to do because we can't keep both of them at the same time. And what the Hubs end up doing in this case they use the hash as a tiebreaker so we say that you know because the timestamps tie we'll actually look at the hash and you know we'll define an ordering on the hash. So we'll say that this starts with two this is two they're the same this is one this is four and arbitrarily we'll say that the higher hash the one with the greater number or the greater lexicographic order is the winner and we'll go ahead and discard this hash. Now this kind of maps to user intent for the most part right if the user has given us explicit timestamp and said this one's later than this one we'll respect that if they've given us conflicting timestamps then we'll make an arbitrary but deterministic decision that will happen the same way no matter how these messages are received. And so that allows us to guarantee that Hubs that see the same messages always end up in the same state and this is an important property right so like let's imagine that you know the actual sequence of events goes like Bob likes a message Bob unlikes it Bob says that was an accident and decides to like it again so at a future timestamp let's call this 99 Bob actually produces a different hash and a different message and this one actually says that Bob likes it again. Now the cool thing about the algorithm that we've defined is that no matter which order these messages arrive they'll always end up in the same state so you could have the messages sort of come in this order so when this comes in and this one comes in we'll compare the timestamp and then the hashes and let this one win and then when this and this combine together we'll let these two win. But let's say we sort of flip the order around right and actually this message and this message arrives well we actually end up in the same state because we compare the timestamps we realize that this one's later and we keep this one we compare these two we realize this timestamps later and we discard this one so in both cases we end up selecting this is the winner and this is sort of a very important property right because in a in a social network you can have thousands and thousands of messages and it's very common that lots of them are going to get dropped going to get reordered as they go between hubs and all kinds of errors happen and if we can design a system that's resilient to those errors that sort of says like hey no matter how you send these deltas or what order you send them in I'll always be able to get a deterministic state that's a very useful property because it takes all these actions that users are performing and merges them into a into a distinct state and then tells developers hey here is the current state of the network and it guarantees that hubs even when you have hundreds or thousands of them can all come into sync and agree on the same state over time

# Farcaster： Pruning Deltas [MXkquByKMk0]

So we previously established a model for hubs. Alice and Bob post messages, messages go to their hubs, each hub swaps messages with each other, and over time, the hubs have the exact same state of the world. That is, each hub is a full copy of all the messages from Alice and Bob in the network. But we haven't yet talked about who runs hubs. So it's important to figure out what the incentives are for operating these services. The first group of people incentivized to operate hubs are people who are building applications on the network. Now imagine FooCaster, that's actually a service that offers mobile and web apps and shows people advertisements and lets them use the network or maybe charges a subscription instead. FooCaster will want to run its own hub to make sure that it always has access to publish data to the network and to read data from the network. Now, not everybody starts out as serious as FooCaster. Some people just want to play around with the network, see what's possible on day one. So you can imagine that someone starts an API service like Cast API. Cast API runs its own hub, but it allows other applications to connect to this API and fetch data easily over HTTP, similar to what Infura or Alchemy do for Ethereum. This lets people start out by building simple applications using Cast API, and as they get more serious, they can graduate to running their own hub and actually build their own hub and add a third node to the network and so on. Now, there's one problem we haven't talked about yet, and that's what happens if Alice starts posting more and more messages to the network. Now, the immediate side effect is that hubs have to grow larger and larger to store all these messages over time. As hubs get larger, they get more expensive to operate. So you can imagine that there's a certain size at which FooCaster decides it's no longer viable for them to operate their own hub, and decides to just go over to Cast API instead. Alice is now forced to publish all her messages here, and FooCaster also has to read messages from here, and the network becomes less and less decentralized over time. Now, there's another problem that starts to emerge too. Imagine if Bob similarly started posting a lot of messages as well. But Bob's message, unlike Alice's, are all spammy. They're not valuable, they're just filled with junk characters, and Bob is just being annoying on the network. Now, Cast API might rightly build a tool that filters Bob's messages out of the network. So write something that says, hey, everything of Bob, we just will reject it from the hubs, we won't accept these messages. This starts to introduce another problem, which is that operators, now who are very few in number, can be selective about who they let on their network and who they don't let on their network. While they might start doing it for reasons of spam prevention or time this can be abused in certain ways, and it returns us to the old world of social media where a few powerful players can determine what happens on the network. That's not very ideal. One thing that's clear is it's important that there are limits to how big hubs can become. If hubs stay under a certain size, then they will be reasonably cost-effective to run, and then each application developer can run their own hub. But if they become too expensive or too tedious, it's very unlikely and we'll see a greater centralizing force on the world, and it's less likely that the network will remain decentralized over time. It's clear that we can't allow users to store an infinite amount of data on the hubs. There has to be some reasonable boundary on what users can do within a network at any given time. The first way the forecaster defines that is through a concept known as Delta pruning. The way we do that is we say that users are allowed to store messages and publish messages to the network, but messages older than a year get expired from the network. As Alice's message age, hubs will eventually drop them from the network when they become more than a year old. Now, these messages can be preserved on other archival systems. You can imagine an archive.org that stores old messages and all of these other systems that keep these messages. But the protocol itself doesn't guarantee the availability of these messages. It promises the last year's worth of messages, which in most cases is sufficient to build a valid functional social application. The last year's worth of data is probably 99 percent of the most important stuff that your users want to see, and that's actually sufficiently good. Now, some users may get very, very chatty and so in addition to this year's worth of data, there's also an upper size limit. That size limit, the details are in the protocol specification, but it's large enough so that the majority of users will never run into a size limit. But for a minority of users, again, if they exceed that limit, the older messages will get expired. So this pruning allows us to keep the network very robust and very decentralized by ensuring that hubs remain small, that each hub can be operated on a single AWS server, and that most developers will be able to run and operate a hub that has a full copy of the network and will be on an even playing field as far as building a social app goes. Now, there's a couple of interesting ideas that we will probably explore over time, not in the first release, but in future releases. For example, the idea that certain people can pay for additional storage. We know that a very small percentage of users on social media create a lot of content and maybe they want to preserve it for longer or have greater storage, and we might allow them to bid for larger storage slots so that they can store more of the data out of the network, and users who don't post as much will just not take up as much storage anyway, and so overall hubs can still remain small as the network scales. So there's a few other ideas on how to scale this, but overall bounding the size of each set and pruning them helps hubs stay decentralized as the forecaster network grows.

# Farcaster： Secure Messaging Requirements [NDmKOnGherE]

Okay, so today we're going to talk about what makes a secure messaging protocol actually secure. So imagine that Alice is sending a message over to Bob through this protocol. We want to make sure that the protocol exhibits a few properties. The first of which is what we call anti-forgery. So what anti-forgery means is that Bob is able to verify on receipt of a message that Alice and only Alice was the author of that message and nobody else could have produced that message. So this is for obvious reasons an important foundation for any kind of messaging protocol. The second property that we care about is end-to-end encryption or E2E encryption. And most of you are probably familiar with this notion as well, but it's the idea that messages are encrypted and decrypted on the clients and at no point in flight in between those clients are they ever decrypted. And so the idea is that Alice's phone or desktop or laptop encrypts the message using a secret known only to Bob, sends this message over often using a server where it's encrypted and the message lands on Bob's device and then is often decrypted on his client. So end-to-end encryption ensures that as long as nobody knows the secret that Alice and Bob share, nobody's able to read the messages that are in flight between Alice and Bob. Now we'll get to some of the more interesting properties. There's another property that we care about called forward secrecy. And what forward secrecy means is that if the secret between Alice and Bob is compromised, a user can't use it to read all future messages produced by Alice and Bob. So if Alice and Bob just have a single shared secret and they use that to encrypt all of their messages, and if let's say Bob is clumsy and leaked that secret, then an attacker who has that secret can now read all the messages that Alice and Bob ever produce in the future, which is obviously not ideal. And we sort of assume that clients make mistakes or people make mistakes over time and keys might leak. And we want to ensure that we're not using a single secret to encrypt all the messages and that we have some durable system to ensure that if a secret is compromised, only a small portion of messages or ideally a single message is actually readable and the rest of the messages continue to remain secure. Now there's an extension to this idea that we call break-in recovery. And break-in recovery is the notion that if a break-in or a key compromise were to happen, then the system can actually heal itself so that they can continue communicating in a secure manner. So if Bob accidentally leaked one of his keys and it got compromised, we want to ensure that the system automatically self-heals or recovers in such a way that future messages, when they're encrypted and sent, are actually not going to be readable by the attacker and again return to a state of privacy where Bob and Alice have only private messages. The fifth property is one that we'll call metadata privacy. And metadata privacy is an important property as well. So metadata privacy is the notion that while your message content might be encrypted, there's metadata about the message or around the nature of the communication that's also important to keep secure. For example, Alice and Bob might not want the world to know that they've been talking or how many times they've been talking because that in and of itself can leak data about their conversations or what they're trying to communicate with each other. And so we want to make sure that we minimize this as much as possible so that an observer listening to the transfer of messages isn't able to deduce when Alice and Bob are communicating or able to glean any other information that they can use to understand or decode parts of Alice and Bob's communication protocol. Metadata privacy is difficult to eliminate entirely, but we can go to a great extent to actually limit the amount of data that people can actually obtain by snooping on messages or encrypted messages between different parts. So this gives us a framework to basically grade any encryption protocol. We want to make sure that it's a protocol where messages can't be forged or messages are encrypted end to end between clients, where the protocol ensures forward secrecy and break and recovery so that in the case of any compromise, the protocol heals itself and the compromise of one key does not mean that all messages are compromised, but that only a small set of messages are compromised. And finally, we also want to ensure that the metadata itself is private so that if Alice and Bob are communicating, the rest of the world is enabled to easily determine when and how and how often that they're communicating with each other.

# Farcaster： Sync [Uqga87HWs_g]

We're going to talk about how sync works on the Forecaster protocol. So when you have an application, this little orange box over here that produces a message, you care about two things. You want to make sure that this message, created by a user of this application, gets propagated to every other hub and every other application very quickly. And you also want to make sure that this process is reliable so that these messages always are guaranteed to show up on other applications. The way we achieve this is by having hubs set up a gossip communication protocol with each other. So each hub knows the address of every other hub on the network. It opens up a UDP connection to the network and then sends messages over this gossip channel. So let's say a user creates a new message or a delta. They upload this from the application to the hub over an RPC API, and the hub will go ahead and send this out over the gossip channel to every hub that it knows about, which can then update their own internal state and alert their applications that there are new messages. Now, one problem with gossip is that messages can sometimes be lossy. So let's say we have another message over here. Sometimes this can make it across to one hub, but then fail entirely to make it across to this hub, leaving it in a slightly different state. The other challenge is that gossip doesn't guarantee the ordering of messages, which in some cases is important to reach consistency. Remember, we talked earlier about how there are certain messages called signers, which are represented with these solid squares over here, and all other messages have to be signed by the key pair present in that signer message or the public key present in that signer message. The challenge here is let's say that somebody introduces a new signer, right? They decide to change the default key with which they sign messages and will represent this with blue over here, and they upload it to this hub. They then upload another message, which is signed by this new blue signer, which gets uploaded to this hub and everything's fine. Now this goes ahead and gossips out these messages. So the new signer gets sent over first, it's accepted, we all are aware of the new signer, then the new signer message is sent out and that also gets accepted. But if they end up going in the reverse order, let's say this message goes first, this hub will reject it because it isn't aware of the signer and thinks this is an unauthorized message. So this sort of goes away. And then later when this message shows up, it'll be accepted. But now again, this hub's in a state where it's missed one of these messages and we'll never see it again because the gossip protocol doesn't broadcast itself. So in order to bring hubs into state, we actually have to introduce a second process that we call an out of band sync process. So hubs also periodically will talk to each other and request a full state. So what they'll do is they sort of have a Merkle tree that represents the state of all their messages, and they'll do a comparison, they'll find all the missing messages, and then they'll go ahead and download these messages over this channel and add them over here. Now the difference between these two sync processes is that gossip is super fast, so it guarantees that most of your messages get out in a couple of seconds, whereas diff sync is thorough, but is very slow. So it takes much longer to perform a full diff. It uses TCP and more reliable connections to download these messages. And so this process is much more expensive. So gossip might happen many times a second or every few seconds, while the diff sync process may happen once or twice a minute, just to help hubs catch up with any state that they've missed out on. Now one other thing to talk about is how new hubs enter and join the network. So let's say you have a new hub, and it comes in over here. Each hub must at first know the address of at least one other hub on the network to begin the bootstrapping process. And there'll be public hubs advertised one run by the forecaster protocol, and it should be pretty easy to get these addresses. But this hub will immediately set up a gossip connection to this hub and start downloading the contact information of all these other hubs, and then go ahead and set up communication channel with all of these hubs as well. So at this point, you have channels open between this hub and every other hub, and they start receiving messages over gossip. Now because this hub starts off in an empty state, it will also perform a full diff sync with this first hub, downloading all of the messages it knows about to catch up to the most recent state of the network. So it'll actually also have an immediate diff sync channel, and then we'll continue to do this periodically every few minutes or so. So this is how our sync architecture works. We use a combination of gossip to send out messages very, very quickly, and a diff sync process or an out of band sync process that helps us catch up to messages that gossip didn't deliver that accurately, that ensures that we will always converge to the same state and have all the same messages across applications. Now, this is a very simple architecture. There's a lot of knobs we can tweak over here, including creating sub meshes within the gossip network and optimizing the delivery of these messages. But we're going to start simple and have it be a more flood-like system where all the messages are broadcast out. And as the network of hub grows, we can make improvements to this over time.

# Farcaster： System Overview [1TVI2uKgHtY]

In this video, we'll introduce the idea of the layer cake, or the three layers that make up the forecaster network. So we've already talked about some of the primitives. Alice has a key pair that can be used to register an identity on the Ethereum blockchain using an ID contract. Alice can also use the same key pair to produce cryptographically signed messages. We haven't yet talked about where these messages get stored. A simple model for storage might have Alice just putting them on a server, almost like an RSS server of sorts, and Bob could do the same with his messages. You could index all of these different servers to get a copy of all data on the network. Now, a problem with this approach, like let's say you tried to build a search application that wanted to index the whole network and make it searchable. You would have to find every one of these servers, you'd have to deal with availability issues when these servers are offline, and run into all kinds of problems when indexing millions of users at scale. So Forecaster actually takes a different approach to availability, and takes advantage of the property that each of these is a signed tamper-proof message. So what happens on Forecaster is when Alice's server talks to Bob's server, it actually downloads a copy of Bob's messages, which it stores for future reference. And Bob's server does the same as well. It maintains a full copy of all of Alice's messages. That way, when Charlie enters the network with a blank hub, and wants to actually catch up with the network, it simply talks to Bob's server, and it can fetch an entire copy of both Alice's and Bob's messages. And we know that this is trustworthy, because Bob's server can't tamper without any of these messages, without affecting their signature. So this property, by turning each node in the network, or each hub, as we call them, into a peer-to-peer node that has a full copy of the network, we make data availability much simpler and much easier for anyone who joins the network in the future. Now, you also need applications to consume this data. Hubs aren't sufficient to just view social data on the network. And so you can imagine a simple application might just use something on your mobile phone to download messages from a hub and display them in chronological order. Hubs are fairly simple, right? They can just give you a list of messages and maybe order them by time, but they don't do much more than that. So this would be a fairly simple application that could just show you a chronological feed. Now, people do want more sophisticated applications, and you could build those in the system by introducing a proxy back in server. So in this case, you would actually have a server that talks to a hub and that downloads all of these messages from a hub. So it periodically syncs with the hub, pulls down all of these messages, organizes, categorizes them, does whatever fancy machine learning it wants to produce a feed, and then offers APIs that actually connect to mobile clients and generate a feed. And now, this sort of doesn't have to have map one-to-one to a user. A single application like this could actually serve thousands or even millions of users at a time by indexing all of this data. Now, I want to talk a little bit about the key model. So in this case, Alice would take her private key or her custody key and generate a delegate key pair, which would go into this mobile device and use this. And because Alice has control of this device, she has direct control of the key pair, and it's pretty straightforward. Now, in this model, the trust is delegated because Bob actually has to give a message to the server, which is what maintains a connection to the hub. And so Bob issues a delegate key pair to the server, which can now create messages on his behalf. So this is sort of a partially trusted model where Bob gives the server authority to create messages, but can use his custody key to revoke this at any time and move over to a different server or even use multiple servers at once. So these are sort of the ways in which you can build applications, fully decentralized applications that just run on clients that do very simple things, or much more powerful hybrid models where you have sort of this backend service doing some of the data processing and organizing data for you, and then mobile clients that actually download that data and display them to you in a useful and interesting manner. Now, this kind of sets up the idea of the three layers of the Forecaster Layer Kit, right? You have up here your first layer, which you can think of as your identity layer. So we'll call this identity. And this is built on the Ethereum blockchain. Down here, you have what we think of as a data layer, which is simply for the storage and replication of the data. And down here, you have the application layer, which is where you can build useful and interesting social applications by consuming data from this data layer. And they kind of all feed into each other, right? The identity layer establishes who can do things on the network and how they can authorize messages. The data layer stores messages authorized by those people and makes them available. And then finally, the application layer consumes those messages and generates useful feeds and also produces new messages when users create them with their clients and kind of pushes them back up into the data layer. Now, this is kind of an overview of the three parts of the Forecaster Network. There are a few important things we haven't touched on, which we'll cover in future videos, namely, how do we ensure that all of these messages can be stored on these servers and that we don't run out of space? How do we handle conflicts when users create messages that collide with each other? And finally, how do we actually ensure availability, that these messages are always available and that the sync is performing even as they're being sent?

# Farcaster： Trustworthy Identities [ISRyNh6Zd8g]

We previously talked about decentralized social networks, where Alice and Bob have unique identities that represent them. This is particularly important so that when new messages are created by users, they can add this identity into the author field so that everyone knows that Hello World was created by Alice, or they can add it in their relationships such that Alice subscribes to Bob can be represented by Alice's ID over here and Bob's ID over here. So it's important that these IDs are unique. But it's also important that they're decentralized in a way that actually means that Alice and only Alice controls that identity. This is to ensure that nobody else can change these relationships or take these relationships or messages away from Alice at any point in the future, which is a very important property of a decentralized social network. Now, one way to do this is by allowing Alice to claim a username, a human readable username, like at Alice, for example, which is then mapped to and introduced into all of these objects. So the author field can now just say at Alice and Bob knows that it's from Alice. This is a straightforward system. We've actually seen this implemented in a few systems that exist today like ENS, where you can set up an Ethereum smart contract that keeps a mapping of usernames and connects them to Ethereum accounts. It can also ensure that usernames are unique. The same username cannot be issued multiple times, and they can only be associated with a particular Ethereum account, and so on and so forth. So this achieves a decentralized namespace, but it introduces a problem, which is that decentralized names often aren't trustworthy. So let me give you an example. Let's say that Alice had instead of grabbing at Alice, she'd grabbed at Google. Now, all of these messages on the network look like they're from Google and not from Alice. So when Bob looks at these messages or joins a network and sees all of these messages from Google and these other entities that aren't actually from Google, that creates a pretty crappy user experience. So an untrustworthy namespace is not a particularly useful one, and we want to find a way to make our namespace trustworthy. So the way Farcaster approaches this problem is by introducing a new concept known as the Farcaster ID. So rather than grabbing these human-readable usernames, Alice will actually grab an FID, which is a numeric identifier that looks like this. This is the identifier that's used in all our messages. So every time Alice does something or issues a new message, it contains this identifier and this identifier alone. This is particularly important because this identifier is designed in a way that it's fully decentralized. It's issued by a smart contract. Once Alice gets it, it's hers for life. You can issue them in near infinite quantities so they never run out, and everybody can get an identifier, and so on and so forth. The problem with these identifiers is they're somewhat tedious and not friendly to type. If Bob wanted to mention Alice and had to type at 3, 4, 8, 9, that's annoying. So we actually allow Alice to gain an optional username that she can connect back to this ID, such as addAlice. This happens in a separate system, and it's a secondary identity system. It's also unique, but it can only be associated with one of these names. At render time, clients know that add3, 4, 8, 9 is also connected to addAlice, and can go ahead and replace this here. Now, a key difference between the primary and the secondary identity system is the primary system is fully decentralized. Once Alice gets it, it's hers for life. Whereas the secondary identity system is actually governed by the namespace. So the namespace might have a set of rules, let's say for example, that you can impersonate somebody. So if Alice was actually grabbing at Google, for example, and was posting messages on that path, the namespace could claim back this name and say, hey, you're no longer allowed to use this, we've taken your name away from you. But importantly, even when this happens, all of these messages and all of these relationships continue existing because Alice is still in control of this ID, 3, 4, 8, 9, which at a later date, she can go and tie back to a different username, like Alice123, and then all the clients will simply replace this username, which is largely a cosmetic identifier at this point, that makes it easier to identify someone, but it's no longer your primary ID. Separating the concept of an identity into a fully decentralized primary ID called the Forecaster ID, and a governed namespace called the ForecasterName, actually allows us to achieve this balance between having a decentralized namespace, but also ensuring that it's trustworthy at the same time. The way it's implemented is we have a second contract on the Ethereum blockchain that maps ID numbers to addresses. There's two contracts, the ID registry and the name registry that form the basis of the Forecaster Identity System. Users must have a primary ID, they must register one of these before they can create messages, and they can optionally choose to register an FName or a ForecasterName. By connecting it to the same account, you link the FName and the FID together, and applications can actually render a username when people are browsing applications.

Dan, welcome to Mint Season 6. What's up, man? How are you doing? Thank you for being on. Well, thanks for having me. I'm excited to have you on the podcast. A lot is going on in the Web3 social space and what better person to talk to than the one who's building Farcaster, right? I've been on Farcaster. A lot of people use Farcaster. A lot of excitement across crypto Twitter. It also now migrates to Farcaster and vice versa. So a lot to talk about. I want to start with you, though. Who are you? What does the world need to know about you? And more specifically, how did you get your start into crypto? Yeah, so I think my background, I'm originally from Massachusetts. I went to school on the East Coast, worked in Boston for a bit, and then eventually moved to Silicon Valley. I started on the operational side of things. So I didn't study something technical in undergrad. I grew up kind of always with computers, programming, kind of mucking around with the internals of stuff, but for whatever reason, didn't major in it in college. But when I moved out to Silicon Valley, I had worked in consulting, so kind of got a job more on the operational side of things. And I was working at a SaaS company that does visitor sign-in software for iPads. And I just kept hearing about Bitcoin from all of the smart people I had started to meet in the Bay Area. And I realized I didn't have my own point of view on it. And actually, if you back up, when I first moved to Silicon Valley, a college classmate of mine, Fred Ursham, one of the co-founders of Coinbase, heard that I was moving out, reached out, we got coffee, mentioned that he had just raised a Series A for Coinbase and we're looking to kind of hire out the first few employees. And I categorically dismissed him thinking that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme. Why would you be spending your time on that? Why don't you work on a real tech company? Fast forward a year later, I actually had read the white paper finally and couldn't stop thinking about Bitcoin. And I think that the thing that got me most excited about Bitcoin in the kind of early days, enough to make the switch over to Coinbase, was thinking about it as a computing layer and kind of thinking about, if you think about like computing history, you kind of go from mainframes to the kind of like PCs, then you add the internet, then you add mobile, and then you start to go away from the local machine to the cloud. And so each one of these new platforms offers really interesting opportunities for entrepreneurs and to build new products and experiences, mobile being the most recent. And in 2014, I thought, okay, Bitcoin is clearly that next computing platform, right? You can start to do new experiences that don't live within a centralized database. And the first applications of that being money and payments. And so I joined Coinbase very much thinking it was going to be all about the new apps that were going to be built on top of the Coinbase API, which ended up being wrong. And I'm happy to talk through my experience at Coinbase and what I learned there. So I kind of went in with a very naive point of view and then stuck around for five years and in many ways got lucky in the sense that the market shifted and something like Ethereum came along and the company did end up doing well. But I always like to point out that I joined Coinbase with the completely wrong thesis for what was going to be big, at least for Bitcoin. And I think we're finally actually starting to play out with some of the ideas that I originally were excited about in 2014. But that's how I got started. What were some of those original ideas that now you're sort of seeing get played out right now? Well, the ideas that I, there was like one very concrete idea that I got excited about was prediction markets. And there was a paper from the Mercatus Center, I think Jerry Breida, who now runs Coin Center, was still in academia and he wrote it, just talking about the history of different prediction markets from a theoretical standpoint. And I've always found that to be fascinating. I'm a bit of a political news junkie. And so the idea that you could kind of use markets to predict elections better than polling is I've always found intellectually interesting. And so that they talked about potentially using Bitcoin because one of the fundamental issues is in the US, if you want to offer a prediction market, that's considered a derivative, which is regulated by the CFTC. And there's a notable example of a company that wanted to do a prediction market specifically for Hollywood movies. It's called Hollywood Exchange. They raised a bunch of funding, built out a product, and they went to go launch this product, which essentially would allow you to bet on what the box office receipts for a movie would be. And Hollywood cracked down by doing a bunch of lobbying in DC, which ultimately got the CFTC to shut it down because they didn't want people to be betting, especially insiders to be betting on whether a movie was going to flop or not, because then you would start using that information as a consumer to potentially not go see that movie because people thought it would be bad. Which is kind of interesting if you think about it from a consumer benefit standpoint, that Hollywood Exchange would be great. For Hollywood, it would be bad in the sense that they couldn't really package up bad movies and try to promote them. But CFTC decided that that wasn't allowed and so that doesn't exist. There's actually now an exchange in the kind of more fintech world that is not crypto related called the Call Sheet. And they are one of the first kind of more consumer oriented prediction markets that have found some amount of CFTC approval, or at least the set of markets that they're doing. But I think that the other thing that I just generally got excited about in crypto is regulated markets are fine and Coinbase, the experience I had there, we did a lot with regulation and you have to get it right. And it actually ends up creating a lot of value for business because not a lot of people want to do it. Some people call that regulatory capture. But there's a kind of aspect of the internet that I've always been interested in is permissionless innovation. And I think the ethos of the internet is if you have a good idea, you should, and a computer and the capability to program something, you should just be able to do it. And with fintech, it's much more, okay, if you can go convince people to raise money, then you can go build out like a special relationship with other banks or card processing companies. And then you can put an API on top of that, right? A company like Stripe or a company like Plaid has done an excellent job of managing that. And actually, by virtue of them being very developer oriented, have significantly increased the number of apps that exist in the world of fintech, because each of those kind of apps that sit on top of a Plaid or a Stripe, they don't have to go do those relationships directly. But what's neat about crypto is you don't even need the middleman. The APIs and the data and the value are directly accessible to the end user as well as the driver. And I think that concept of removing a huge chunk of intermediaries is just like a concept that I think is really fascinating. And frankly, one of the most compelling reasons to work in technology for me is you can actually build these things on the internet that can exist as protocols that create coordination between humans, but not necessarily any one individual or company. So is that where social comes into the picture? Because of the things that you said that interest you, you didn't bring up social media as the keyword sort of within that entire explanation. I'm curious, where does social fit into that vision of yours? That excitement? Yeah, I think 2014, I wasn't thinking about social as a crypto thing in that, A, when I first started at Coinbase, we were Bitcoin only, and the push was payments, which ended up again, not quite playing out. And what Coinbase ended up becoming is more of an investment platform, but also a gateway into being able to take Bitcoin or ETH and then put it into, whether it's DeFi or any kind of permissionlessly built app on top of these blockchains. So that's an important function, right? It's not just purely financial exposure. But in 2014, at least when I was joining Coinbase, I think that was right around when Twitter was potentially hamstringing the API. But prior to that, Twitter had a very open API. And so you had a very diverse ecosystem of third party clients. I like to always point out that the pull to refresh, the kind of universal of whether you're using a mail client today or Instagram to just refresh your feed, that was invented by a third party indie developer, Lauren Brichter, who had an app called Tweety, which eventually ended up selling to Twitter. And then Twitter technically owns the patent for pull to refresh. And they did something that's quite honorable. They kind of said, hey, we'll never prosecute anyone for using it. But that was an era where I think that there was still a lot of promise in social media as potentially this API driven. Yes, there were going to be kind of first party clients, but third party clients, there could be a diverse ecosystem, especially for something like Twitter. Fast forward to 2022, I think we're in a far different state of the world related to social networks, social media, in that they are more centralized. There are, I think, a stricter set of guidelines in terms of what's acceptable use versus not. And I think in some ways there are some good aspects of that. But at the same time, I think it's kind of wild if you think about something like Twitter. You have a bunch of people in San Francisco making decisions on what is acceptable speech or use for the entire world, which is wild. Whereas something like the internet, again, it's country by country. But to me, that's a much more credibly neutral platform in the sense that the US has strong free speech laws. So if you maintain your own website and you don't follow a foul, very limited set of things that would violate free speech, that's on you or you and your hosting provider. Whereas if you live in another country that maybe has stricter limits on speech, that's your version of the internet. But what's neat is it kind of is global and you as an individual, if you either get outside of your country or maybe have a pseudonymous way of publishing, you really can get access to the direct level of the protocol. Whereas with these social networks, you're much more limited in terms of where that company's leadership and jurisdiction is for the company. And then that kind of propagates out to the rest of the world. And so I think where my thinking from 2014 to 2020, 2022 era has changed is we've gotten significantly more centralized with social media and social networks. They're significantly larger and more present in terms of just public discourse. And I think we're starting to see the scenes where they just they can't scale at this level and maintain some of the core original promises that they have. You go back to the early product marketing for Twitter as they were very pro free speech. Like that was actually their differentiator is, hey, Twitter is a place to be able to express what you think, whether you're in the US or I don't know, a country in the Middle East, the whole Arab Spring was a moment for Twitter, at least in that moment. And I think that's changed quite a bit. The question is, as a society, should we have a neutral public square protocol that allows us to do some of the things that centralized social media is significantly better than kind of open protocols? Right. So the open protocols here would be the web, email, RSS. But can you actually take some of the best aspects of centralized social media from the user ability standpoint, discoverability, and actually bring those into something that looks more credibly neutral, like a more traditional Internet protocol? And so that's the thing that I got excited about and why I'm working on it now. Interesting. So I think we're seeing an increase of like set of adoption across web through social applications, whether it be from people trying to build applications to users trying to use these applications or creators trying to create content and monetize through these applications. And I'm still trying to understand the space from like a macro lens. I'm curious to hear your point of view. What do you think is the current state of web through social? We're early. I think there are a variety of different approaches. There are probably more additional networks that pop up and people with different points of view on how to do things. We are also in a slightly different situation compared to maybe some other technology trends in that if you take the examples of Twitter and Facebook, they were kind of in that first generation of social media, the web to social media. And so a lot of the stuff is getting figured out for the first time. For the most part, because you had some some earlier social networks, Friendster, MySpace, but the inflection point was really as society shifted over to mobile as being the dominant form factor that actually massively increases the amount of social media use rather than being something that I'm going to set up my computer and use Facebook versus being on the couch watching TV and also having Facebook open. And so I think with Web3, you're not in a situation where you're competing mostly against Greenfield like in that you are in a Greenfield situation. You're competing against mature Web2 social networks for time spent. And so if you think about social, it's a zero sum game in that you only have a limited amount of time. You can't spend time on two social networks at once. So if you're spending it on one social network or watching Netflix, that's the trade off. And so I think Web3 social is early days in terms of infrastructure development, the protocol layer as well as app development on top, but also in the kind of figuring out what's the differentiator versus the mature options that basically everyone is already on. It's not like people are onboarding to social media for the first time with Web3 social. They're already on Web2 social media. And if anything, that's actually where you're finding a lot of those people as a developer of a Web3 social media product. But the challenge is, OK, I already have a big audience on Web2 social media. I have the habit. I've spent time curating my feed. I like the algorithmic stuff that I'm getting. Maybe you don't. But to then actually get everything up and running in Web3, that's where we really are right now. Can you actually offer something that is reasonably competitive such that someone is willing to trade off time spent over here in Web3? And so that's actually something that we've been really focused on for the last two years is building the initial client for Farcaster, the protocol. Because from our point of view, the thing that's actually going to drive the most switching is you have to have a base level of feature parity. You can't say, hey, this is a really rough app, but it's decentralized. No one's going to switch to that. Whereas if you can get a mobile app that from a performance standpoint feels pretty close, maybe not quite there, and then a sufficient number of people that are interesting, then you might start to get the early adopters who say, oh, this is actually kind of nice. The spam bots aren't here. I actually have more control over what I see in my feed. But I think that's a pretty slow process. Whereas maybe fast forward two or three years from now, and you have a variety of attempts in Web3 social that have kind of gotten that first stage done, you may start to see actually apps grow at a faster clip, a more mainstream audience clip. But I think where we are right now is in that kind of early adopter deployment phase. And then you have this kind of challenge of like, okay, well, how do you cross that chasm to mainstream? But I actually think it's like you need to focus on the first phase first before you even worry about the main phase. I think there are a lot of people who when they think Web3 social, and I think NFTs in a positive way kind of increase the aperture of what crypto can be for people, rather than this kind of like very finance, quantitative, numeric thing. There's a visual element, a very consumer element. Yes, there's a financial element to it. But I think as a result of that, a lot of people, especially with the kind of bull market of 2021, wanted to proclaim, okay, this is crypto's mainstream moment. And I can tell you having worked in crypto since 2014, people have been saying this is crypto's mainstream moment for eight years. And I think it's just the wrong frame, right? I don't think we get to a sudden, okay, this is now mainstream. Because I think the analogies people like to use, oh, this is like 1993. And now we have Netscape that's going to kind of kick off this adoption. The difference is there was no internet before. Whereas now with crypto, it's a subset of the internet. So inevitably, like it isn't a step function of a change for a consumer. If you just kind of the simple thing of, okay, I can get an Uber with Uber, or someone goes build the centralized Uber, you still get the Uber. Whereas pre-internet, there was no Uber, taxis or whatever, but the step function change is the zero to one. And I think where crypto is always fairly or unfairly compared is this, I think when people are being unreasonable, they're trying to say it's a step function change, but it's probably more incremental. And I think that's even the wrong frame to be thinking about as an entrepreneur, because I actually think what's interesting is if you can just actually shift to say what new experiences or things that are fundamentally not possible in web two, can you actually start to build? And so that's one of the first principles in terms of building that we've approached with Farcaster is use the amount of web two or web three as minimal as possible. Like the amount of stuff we put on chain is as small as possible and then leverage everything else from web two, that's great in terms of usability and speed and all of that. And see if you can actually start to get to a fundamentally new experience. And in our case, it's a social network where the backend is truly a protocol and is permissionless. And then figure out, okay, how do you scale that from there without trying to say that everything is fundamentally better? Because to be totally frank, it's not. Our client for Farcaster is pretty good, but it is not as good as something like Twitter yet. And so there's a lot of work to do. But I think that's okay because just like having an open brainstorm session, I just reached, I feel like a stage on Twitter. I just crossed 10K followers. And as a creator, as a content creator, that's a pivotal moment for me and for many other creators. But I still like going to these other platforms because they act as pockets of information and they act as pockets of reset. I feel like there's too much going on sometimes on these mainstream platforms. Whereas in these new social platforms, it's like things are just starting to cook up. Like

# From Coinbase Employee #20 to Building Farcaster with Dan Romero [nXsgSaM_vE8]_part2

Like it's not there. And the types of conversations you see having on those platforms are different than the conversations you have on the mainstream platforms, right? So I see it from like an information pocket point of view. Right? Another thing that's super interesting is like, I know you're big on history, right? And also the way you speak, I noticed like you referenced a lot of like learning lessons and insights that you sort of developed and picked up on like as you saw social media kind of develop. I'm curious, can you share more about like the history around the social graph, right? And if you build a web three social graph, like what sort of problems are you aiming to fix? Right? Big picture. What did web two social graphs do wrong that you think, yeah, like these more open permissionless protocols can do right? Yeah. So I actually don't think there's a ton of great reading out there. You kind of had to experience some of it. And I was fortunate that I was not super old yet, but I was in high school enough that I really got to see the full rise of web two social media. But the kind of things to think about are, you have the kind of early version of the internet, which was very much about read, right? So it's a kind of consuming information, weather information, sports scores, stocks. And then as the performance of browsers and broadband connections, you started to move to this kind of interactive model where you could effectively use a web application as in lieu of using desktop software, right? And as that happened, you had the kind of first wave of social networks, Facebook in 2004, Twitter, I think 2006, and a whole bunch of other ones that popped up. But what's interesting is in that era, the primary way of bootstrapping those social graphs outside of just people kind of friending each other on Facebook specifically because they went to school together. So that was actually gated on email. If you look at some of the growth tactics, this is what I've been told at least, that Facebook used, it was kind of the contact importer from your email address, right? It's like sign in with your Gmail or upload your contact list. And that in of itself kind of was able to create a pretty big graph. And what's interesting about that is, so let's say 10 of my friends had signed up for Facebook. And I show up to Facebook because I was in their contact book. Facebook actually had enough information to make a recommendation of here are some potential friends. And I think there's the kind of apocryphal story of get to the 10 friends is the magic number and then Facebook user. So that was the Facebook implementation is gate on email based on school, get concentration in those schools, expand out to other schools. And then eventually, once you have all the college students in the US, you can expand out to the rest of the world. And the thing I always like to kind of point out is if you think about it, Facebook stopped being cool the moment it stopped being only for colleges, but because they had created such a high concentration of very engaged users at a, I think a critical cool juncture for society, right? Everyone younger than a college student thinks they're cool because they're in college and then people who are graduated from college wish they were back in college. And so my theory on that is that that concentration of basically college students had this crazy half-life where even if college student engagement started to slowly decline on Facebook, it didn't matter because the rest of the world wanted to kind of go after that original feel. And then you eventually get to several billion people using that phenomenal success from building a social graph. Twitter a little different in that it was a little bit more SF tech scene. And the South by Southwest, and it kind of started actually as a slightly older platform relative to, if you look at a lot of social networks, they tend to be younger. And the push with Twitter is, if you actually look at it, it just didn't grow that much in the scheme of things for the first five years. And really it's only in the last five, seven years that it's had a significant, like really big impact on society. It really kind of run the 2016 election. I think Twitter became a lot more mainstream. Obviously always high status from the hashtag or the app reply, but in terms of Twitter being used as kind of this true internet public square, I think 2016 and after that's where Twitter, and then part of it is the president was using Twitter directly. And so I think that network, I don't have as much insight into exactly how the social graph developed, but that said, I also think one thing to think about with Twitter is Twitter is not a social network for most people who use it. I think on the order of 200 million people use Twitter every day. What percentage of people are actually tweeting, liking, replying, it's relatively small. Whereas I think most people use Twitter as an information feed and just simply a way to catch up on news. Whereas you or I, the way we use Twitter is this kind of intellectual thought leadership network where you're meeting other like-minded people in your industry to kind of have a better perspective on whatever you're working on. And that version of Twitter is what it started with, but really has not expanded. We didn't have a hundred million people all of a sudden doing threats on Twitter, right? And so that's actually something that's influenced our thinking with Farcaster is, if you actually think of the addressable market that you have to go after in order to be something that's competitive with Twitter, that total number of users of the 200 million people using it every day, that's a daunting number and it feels like you can never get there. But if you reframe it to say, actually the Twitter version that we're trying to compete with early on is go for the people who use Twitter as kind of this public intellectual social network. Then that's a far smaller number and it makes it more achievable, right? Like you go from being barely any way that the percentage of the way there to, okay, maybe you can get to like 0.1% and then to 0.5%, 1%, 10%. And so I think that is a way of reframing what we're going after. And the other interesting thing about people who use Twitter as a social network is they're the ones who hit the problems the most, right? They post about, you know, Metamask or the future of crypto wallets and then they get all the crypto spam responding to them, right? You take a lot of time to craft, whether it's a thread or a post for your podcast and for whatever reason, the algo is like, oh, you put a link, we don't want you clicking on the link because that kicks you out of the app. Okay, it gets downgraded. And so that is where I think the opportunity for a new social network, at least in the bootstrapping mechanism, it's to go after the people that feel the acute pain points of Twitter. But the challenge with those people, and I think we've talked about this on DM, is you're trying to build an audience. And so you're gonna optimize for the platform where you feel like you're gonna get the most reach. And so for something like Farcaster, where we're approaching it with this kind of very deliberate growth, invite only 3,000-ish people in a beta, it's gonna be hard to justify for you as a content creator to say, hey, I'm gonna spend more time on Farcaster because I really wanna build my audience if you feel like there's more potential on either another web-based social network or realistically something like Twitter. And it's actually an insight that when we launched Farcaster last year, I onboarded a whole bunch of people that I would call are my Twitter friends and people in my professional network. And they had talked a lot about, for a long time, about the need for a decentralized version of Twitter. And so I start working on this thing. I'm ready to onboard them. They go through an onboarding with me. They're really excited. They're like, wow, this is actually pretty decent. Never come back. And I reach out to them and ask, well, why didn't you come back? You told me that you thought this is an important thing. And whether they were willing to admit it or not, I think I finally figured out, and this is obvious in retrospect, but I think you sometimes have to just go through the hard lesson of it, is if you have 500,000 or 800,000 followers on Twitter and you have 80 followers on a nascent social network, how are you gonna justify spending the time on that network out of just pure passion or interest? But those people are busy. So of course they're gonna default to the thing that has massive distribution because ultimately if you're playing this kind of public intellectual social network game, what you care about is mean propagation and idea propagation. And so quantity does matter. Now, I think one thing I would say is quality has been very hard to measure traditionally. And I think one interesting thing about a decentralized social network that is crypto native like Farcaster is one, you can now have a whole bunch of competing companies have full access to the entire data set. So one thing about Twitter, like the proverbial fire hose, I think that that's pretty limited and who has access to it. I don't even know if they even give access to it at this point. But the idea is you can't actually do a full measure of the entire network. You have to do sampling. Whereas with something like Farcaster, you can genuinely, you can just actually index the entire network. And then what's interesting is you can also look at the on-chain activity. And so you can actually use that on-chain activity in two ways I think is interesting. Is one, you can quickly figure out if things look spammy, right? Because it's very expensive to put high value NFT or even $5,000 worth of Ethereum into a whole bunch of addresses to kind of fake an account. Whereas contrast that to a Twitter account, bot account where, I think a lot of times they just need a phone number which you can programmatically create with VoIP. And so I think that that becomes really interesting because you can actually start to measure the quality by whatever metric you want of your audience in a way that in Web2, you get a little bit of it like Facebook can have some centralized reporting tools, but it's pretty general and crude. Whereas I think you get a lot more detail with Web3 and maybe it doesn't always sit the same. Maybe we get a little bit more privacy on-chain in terms of what we're doing. But I think it's an underexplored area. And I think as we scale Farcaster, I do think people are gonna build some interesting tools so that you have a much better understanding of your audience. Building on a decentralized crypto native network like Farcaster, and yes, your audience might only be 10% or 1% of your audience on Twitter, but you have higher confidence that it's actually a higher value audience and an audience that might actually refer your podcast to another front, right? And so I think that's like one element that we're trying to figure out because it's just gonna be a really long time before we ever kind of reach the level of scale that Web2 social networks have. I'm curious, Dan, because I'm trying to figure out what does it mean to be a crypto native creator, let alone build an audience using Web3 primitives, right? So one thing that I've been experimenting with is giving out NFTs to my listeners as a way to kind of prove their participation across seasons, right? And over time, there's been thousands of NFTs that have been minted. And now I'm trying to use that information to create better content for them by seeing their activity on-chain so that I can find better sponsors, et cetera, find better guests. So if I notice that a lot of people have been, for example, collecting music NFTs, that tells me I should be having more music NFT related conversations. If I see a lot of activity around like Web3 social applications, right? Then I wanna have more Web3 native social conversations, right? Hence why I did like this season on like Web3 social media, data, like interoperability, et cetera, right? And I'm trying to figure out still, like what does it mean to be a crypto native creator and build an audience in Web3, right? Do you have any insight on that? Like, do you have any opinions on that? Well, I think you're on the frontier. So what you're coming up with from an idea standpoint is the innovation that, you know, enough people doing it, you'll start to come up with the new patterns that may be more crypto native or Web3 native. And so one thing that you mentioned that I think is really interesting is you actually have insight into what your listeners, assuming you kind of correlate listeners on a Web3 social network like Forecaster or other ones, you can actually look at their on-chain activity and then start to glean insights and say, oh, interesting. 100 people who are following me also have the new Reddit avatar that's on Polygon, I think. And maybe I should actually reach out to Reddit and see if I can find the lead engineer or product manager who did that product as a way for you to offer a more compelling interview that is really relevant to your audience or at least a portion of your audience. And then that person might not have been interviewed before in terms of like a bigger podcast show that tends to focus on the CEO or something like that. And so I think that those insights that you can start to permissionlessly get from your audience may offer better tailored content for your audience or like subset segments of your audience. I also think that the concept of fandom is, I'm not nearly as deep as some of the other people in the space who are building dedicated companies to this, but I just think it's a really interesting concept. Because if you take Crypto on Web3 and put it this up, for as long as music has existed, there's always been that kind of early fan hipster who finds a band, really enjoys them when they're kind of under the radar and really passionate about it. That early passion creates some word of mouth, which creates more, and then that network effect, right? You can kind of model a band like a social network, gets big enough that the band becomes more mainstream, which then brings in even more people. But the original people who were early kind of get disaffected. It's like, oh, I liked them before they got big or they sold out or whatever. And just the idea that there could be a provable way, not even have a financial setup, just a provable way to say, oh, I used to listen to X artists before they were cool, right, the classic hipster line. And it's like, okay, well, prove it. Like show me the music NFT, or you get to a level where every Spotify stream somehow is in a decentralized data structure. We're ways away from that if that ever happens. But you can generally understand the concept that provable, skin in the game, historical on kind of an immutable ledger, it starts to open up some new interesting experiences, right? Maybe those artists now can actually say, hey, yeah, we're really big. We do these big stadium tours, but every year we do a concert in New York City at Madison Square Garden for our original 50,000 fans. And for the rest of your life, you have access to that concert. That kind of seems interesting. You can find someone like a Web2 person who hates Web3 is gonna go, oh, wait, well, you could have had a fan club and then you can do, fine, yeah, you could do that. But I think like part of the beauty of Web3 is it changes people kind of to think bigger or new paradigms. And the ability to permissionlessly do that is pretty cool, right? Imagine if you give a free concert to your original 10,000 fans, don't even need to pay, just show up to the door, show me the NFT, that's it. Like no money exchange has this pure brand. Can't do that in Web2 for the most part, right? Like you'd have to maintain this list and well, okay, what happens when you wanna switch providers? Whereas if it just lives on the blockchain, it doesn't matter, like that NFT will exist. And so- Let alone try to get that information too. Like when a creator builds an audience on like a Web2 native platform, there's only so much information that they can get access to, right? Whereas in crypto, when you're building these audiences using either tokens or NFT, whatever it may be, right? Like that lives immutably. Like you can always go back to that record. Like one thing that I'm thinking, like at some point, as the podcast grows, I can do some type of like David Letterman type of shit, where I just like rent an auditorium and everybody that's sort of collected my early seasonal NFTs, they'll have access to watch like a live interview with us, right? And experience that. Yeah. I think that's really cool. I'm also trying to think from like a monetization point of view. I think we sort of maybe just skim the surface of what monetization looks like. A lot of my bet is that all media will be tokenized to an extent, right? And all media, everything will be collectible to an extent, in some shape or form. And what does that look like in terms of monetization? So right now, a lot of creators, they measure success from like views on YouTube or subscribes, right? How does that look like in the context of Web3? Does that mean the number of unique holders that you have at scale, right? Does that mean like the number of primary and secondary sales you have? Like what gets, how do you measure the success of a creator? I don't know. I'm thinking out loud over here. But yeah. Well, again, I go back to this idea that I think Web2 is very much about quantity. Everything is about scale, like total number of users. Cristiano Ronaldo has, you know, a hundred million followers on Instagram or Kim Kardashian. And that's how you talk about it. I think biology has come up kind of with this concept of like being able to measure a fan economy is a far more interesting thing. So fine, Kim might have a hundred million followers on Instagram, but what is the GDP of the Kim Kardashian expanded universe, right? Like as a gimmick, but people laugh at that, right? So he was saying this a couple of years ago and now Kim Kardashian's potentially starting a private equity firm based on the fact that she's gonna potentially be able to use that distribution. And so I think that what gets interesting is if you can actually take the distribution out of the silos, like I have this many followers on YouTube, I have this many followers on Twitter and you move it to kind of these decentralized, credibly neutral kind of core data structures where now the relationship is between the creator, the publisher, whatever, and the people who choose to follow them, right? And that is a, actually it's an opt-in relationship, right? Because the person can always unfollow you. It's not like you own that follower forever, right? But the key is that no one can come in and say, oh, you know what, in terms of service violation, we've decided that what you said here is no longer acceptable. You've spent 10 years building an audience, tough luck, boom, right? You get kicked off YouTube or Twitter, there's no recourse, there's no exit, there's no, oh, take your followers, here you go, here are all their emails, now you can email them. And so I think if you look at just the way web to social media is, you as a creator have to spend way more time of, you either take the bet on these platforms will keep you forever, probably fine, or you do the extra effort of, hey, subscribe, also sign up for my newsletter so I don't have a direct line of communication with you. Whereas fast forward, if these web three social protocols work, you as a creator, you just have a direct relationship. You wanna send them a podcast, you wanna send them a video, you wanna send them a cast, can basically come through a variety of different clients, applications, channels, but that relationship is a single relationship and it belongs to the two of you.

# From Coinbase Employee #20 to Building Farcaster with Dan Romero [nXsgSaM_vE8]_part3

two people who've opted to be in it, which I think is a pretty radical shift from what we've been used to in Web2. And that also means you have freedom of monetization. Right. So I think the kind of idea space for monetization is just getting started, not only because you have crypto with this kind of poor financial primitive and you can do things like NFTs and DeFi and the remixability and composability of that, but also just the idea that, okay, I can do a traditional subscription and maybe it's done on chain or maybe it's done through Stripe and a traditional Web2 platform. Fine. I think the challenge is when you are reliant on platforms and in some cases, platforms that are reliant on other platforms, with the example of like if you're on YouTube and then Apple iOS, like there are two rent seeking platforms that want to take dollars before they even get to you. Right. And so the most extreme example was I think Meta, Oculus, they were trying to do a platform for that. And then they had a Facebook, like Horizons platform cut. And I want to say if you did the thing on an iPhone, it had like an iOS, like it was just like cuts all the way down. Right. And what's great about Web3 is you can actually solidify through a cryptographic proof. Again, the average user doesn't need to see this, but from a developer standpoint, that relationship between the creator and a person in their audience, as well as what also gets interesting audience to audience connections. Right. And so that's another interesting thing that's hard to measure. But if you think about it, what if you're Taylor Swift and you want your whole fan club, maybe Taylor Swift is big enough to have like a custom social app that people are willing to even show up to. Whereas most other artists or creators, you're never going to have like a custom app that people are going to use. They're basically their time spent as an Instagram, their time spent as in Twitter. And so you kind of have to play the game there because that's where the attention is. Whereas I think with these kind of remixable, composable, open access social protocols, I think there's a totally foreseeable future where for the three or five creators, whether that's a video creator or a music artist, if I want to have a direct relationship with them, I'm using one of these open protocols because it actually just does a lot of the plumbing for me. And then there's probably some version of call it WordPress or whatever, where you can kind of, or Squarespace, where you can basically as a creator, have a mobile app that the user is like, Oh, great, this is completely interoperable. So when you post a video, I can get it over here on Twitter, the Twitter one, if I want. But if I really want to go deep with everyone else in the community, I can use this token gated app that based on your show, and I can get really, really deep with other people who are members of the show. And we have seen this, by the way, with like the rise of discords is an indication that there is demand for this. But discord, which look, tremendous products and success in terms of just scale, but it's imperfect in the sense that it's not really optimized for mobile. It's a gamer product at the end of the day. Right. And so it's a very desktop heavy experience. Whereas if you think about it, like when you as a, as a creator, if you say, Hey, I have a discord and I have 10,000 people in my discord, you're just like another little icon in this whole long set of discord controls, the notifications and all the experience where you could imagine being if, you know, you're my favorite podcast producer, I can actually now install your app, which didn't take you a lot of effort in the scheme of things, no different than a website because it's using these open protocols. And now you get push notifications on my phone that are completely, you know, direct between you and your audience and whatever the experience, right. And so that, that is a ways off and maybe we don't get there. I'm a big believer that we will, but I think you need to get the infrastructure in place first before entrepreneurs start to say, Oh, this has become a commodity, or this has become this kind of credibly neutral infrastructure that I know I can actually go build these apps for these different creators because this protocol is going to have some level of stability. Right. And I think the example here is obviously email is an example of a protocol that if I really wanted to take the brain damage and go build my own email client, right. Superhuman being the most recent, you can do it. And there is no, you don't have to ask the email consortium for permission. If you understand SMTP and IMAP, like it'll just work. And what's actually even kind of neat is you can build an email client that works with Google and Google, just because at least in the email world kind of has to support IMAP because it's kind of the de facto standard. They don't even really get to say, it's like, Oh wait, so you're, I can actually build on top of your backend and you did all the hard part and just build a better client, which is what I think superhuman is today. Right. They don't have to handle the like low level email plumbing. They're just an IMAP client or a deeper integration with Google. Sure. But I think that that like becomes a pretty powerful thing where if more stuff in social actually has that level of like permission list innovation. And in the case of the building on Google, that's not even permissionless. It's like mostly permissionless. I think you just yield a whole bunch of more interesting experiences, which gets back to this monetization thing is I think we're just scratching the surface. Just to say, Oh, we'll have ad base, we'll have subscriptions, and then we'll have some amount of NFTs. I think you're just at the start. It's like looking at the internet in 1994 and predicting all of the different business models and new companies that have come out of it. Right. Right. Right. One thing that Farcaster tends to be very public about in their branding and their image is that it's a sufficiently decentralized social network. And I think when you come back to it and you ask yourself, what does it mean to be sufficiently decentralized? And I'm sure you get this question all the time. I'm curious, what is the answer to that? What is decentralized on Farcaster? How do you make decisions on what to decentralize versus centralized? Share with me your entire mental model around that. The way to think about how sufficiently decentralized works is there's a spectrum between centralized and decentralized in terms of an application. And in a centralized application, most common example is a company runs a set of APIs. The company decides who uses those APIs can revoke the API keys at any point. And that's basically Twitter. There is no adjudication process for getting back on Twitter. Twitter doesn't want you on Twitter. Tough luck. Right. Same thing goes for the developer. So Twitter has a bunch of APIs. In a prior era, they were much more open. They changed over time. And so that is very much the centralized approach. Other side of things, decentralized. So something like SMTP for email. Git is another good example of one. I can go build a competitor to GitHub and I don't have to ask GitHub for permission. And it'll work out of the box because Git is a decentralized protocol that does not have a corporate owner. But the challenge when you start to get out on the decentralized side of things is the user experience tends to get very technical and way worse. You just need to know how to do everything. RSS is a good example of that. So to use RSS, you need to know, oh, I need to have a feed reader. And it's like, oh, I have a feed reader and I need to keep all of my subscriptions in place. And so the protocol itself tends to be the thing that is more decentralized. And then the spectrum in between is where you can get to something what we'd call sufficiently decentralized. And so from our point of view, rather than start with decentralized and work your way to centralization, it's actually start with centralization and then work your way on the spectrum to decentralization to the point where you can satisfy two conditions. The first is in the case of a social network, any user can have a direct relationship with another user and no one can take them away like that away from them. So if you and I want to be connected, there's no third party that can come in and say, nope, sorry, you can't be connected. The most extreme example of that, obviously, is if you have 100 million followers on Twitter or YouTube and the platform comes in and says, sorry, you don't have a relationship with those followers anymore. So the kind of user to user relationship or creator to audience relationship, that is a core primitive, in my view, for what decentralization is. And then the second thing is the access for developers. So if I want to go build on the data set here and the APIs, there shouldn't be a single individual or company that can come around and say, sorry, in terms of service change, we're going to really actually monetize advertising and sorry, your app doesn't work anymore. And so from our standpoint, the way to accomplish that is the thing that needs to be decentralized is effectively the identity, which is two parts. The first is an ID number. So every person on social media is represented by an internal number in a database is just an ID. And one nice feature of that is on Twitter, you can upgrade your username and you don't lose your followers. It's not like people were following Dan Romero before. And when I switched to DWR, I lost all of them. It's because the way Twitter maps follows is just to that ID number. And then the second thing is the username, which that is much more of a status symbol and a kind of like a your what represents how you interact on these networks. And so if you can remove that from any corporate company and an API, it allows any user to choose whatever client they want and not have to worry about lock in or anything like that. And I think an analogy here is Bitcoin and ETH. When you put it on a company like Coinbase, Coinbase is a centralized company over here, right? Coinbase can choose to kick you off Coinbase. But when Coinbase kicks you off Coinbase, you don't lose your Bitcoin or ETH. You would because, you know, mandatory account closure. That's what happens with Coinbase for some compliance reason. They don't take your money from you. They say, where do you want your money sent? Like, we don't want to do business with you anymore. But you as the user have the ability to exit and then interoperate with everything else in the ecosystem. Right. It's not like special Coinbase Bitcoin. It's no, it's like this is real Bitcoin. And I can move that to FTX. I can move it to a self-hosted wallet. Same thing goes for a social network. So if in the totally centralized version, you get kicked off. There is no ability to exit and then interoperate with the same graph. You have to effectively rebuild it. Right. Another example of this, and there's actually more relevant for social media, is email. So I have a substack and for whatever reason, I might not want to use substack anymore as a publisher or substack doesn't want to host my content. There is no confusion that the email subscriber list that I have belongs to me. Right. And if I take that list and I move to a self-hosted option or a competing newsletter provider, I have uninterrupted access to my subscribers that I worked hard to build that relationship with. And so in our point of view, that's the only thing you actually need to focus on the decentralization. Everything else, you can actually have it be the primary way people deal with stuff is in a centralized client. Right. And the benefit you get from that is the centralized client is going to offer vastly superior user experience because the economy is a scale that start to happen. You probably have cloud-based services versus if you do use the truly decentralized client where you have to host everything yourself, you're now dealing with what happens when the, you know, my client goes down or the host doesn't work, or I have to now upgrade it because there's like a vulnerability in the, you know, the node JS package that's in the open source software. It like the user experience is significantly worse. And the easy answer is why do most people use Gmail and they don't run their own mail server? It's just because it just works. It's easy. Right. And what's interesting about Gmail is you have a Gmail address that's not exit with interoperability. If you have your own domain and use G suite, you can move to a different host, right? Because you own the domain and you can just change where it's pointed. But if you have a Gmail address and you get really attached to that Gmail address, Gmail is not allowing you to move that to Yahoo and say, okay, well the Gmail address now belong with this client over here. Generally, I think Google is pretty good in that you can use other clients that sit on top of it. But the relationship you do have with Gmail is they're looking at all your emails and mining it for data, right? For whatever advertising purposes they want to do. That's part of it being free. But I think that the core of that sufficient decentralization is find the thing that you need to be able to get to be a decentralized point. Keep that decentralized and then let the market develop in a way that you're going to have centralized clients that people opt into and then people can choose more decentralized clients. Yeah. I feel like, Dan, we need to have a three-hour long podcast episode because I've maybe asked three questions in this entire 53 minutes and I'm impressed with how much you have to say around some of the questions. That's probably going to be too perverse. But I want to jump to some community questions that we had come across Twitter, Farcaster, etc. Okay. So this one comes from Martin. How do you see clients for Farcaster evolving plus monetization plans in the future? And we can even do this thing like fire rounds kind of thing. Yeah. We have the initial client. I think we've been building it for two years. It's hit a certain level of polish usability. We have a mobile client, desktop client. So we've done a lot of work to kind of make it easy to onboard to Farcaster as a protocol. Everyone who onboards to... So the company is named Merkle Manufacturing, Farcaster as the protocol. Anyone who onboards to a Merkle Manufacturing client has this really nice, easy experience, gets in. Now they're active on Farcaster, which now also means that they're an addressable user for anyone who wants to build within the Farcaster ecosystem. Because now as a developer building a new client or experience, I don't have to worry about going and convince someone to sign up for Farcaster. I already know that they're there. I can actually just kind of focus on, okay, here are the active users. Let me try to market my product or go to market in terms of that. And by the way, you can post in the feed and people will respond and you know that they're native Farcaster users, right? So there's some built-in distribution there, which as we add more users to the protocol, then the distribution gets better. The natural place for clients to start, which has already happened, is simple view clients that are kind of just doing read-only operations, right? So most of the apps that have been built in the Farcaster ecosystem today have been kind of read-only where they index all the data or rely on a third-party indexer and then are able to show kind of a specialized view. So an example of this is Instacaster shows all of the posts on Farcaster that have an image. Pretty straightforward, pretty interesting UI, relatively easy to boot up. But right now it doesn't have the ability to also use that client to then post back an image into Farcaster. We've been doing a lot of upgrades to the underlying protocol over the last few months. We're going to hopefully get there and offer a much easier way for a developer to actually now go from just read access to both read-write. And that write access is where I think you're going to start to see people do two things. So the first is actually just, okay, I'm going to be a specialized client that does something really well. I don't know, maybe it surfaces all the questions on Farcaster, all the recommendations, and it shows it in a slightly different way. And anytime you take an action there, maybe you like something, it kind of propagates back into the protocol and then it would reflect in that kind of like feed experience for other users. Those are probably the easiest places to start because they're smaller projects. Maybe you can do them over a weekend or a week and you start from there. I think that the longer term, you'll have people building completely new social experiences and using Farcaster to bootstrap the social graph and all of those interactions, the likes, the replies, because it kind of get it out of the box for free. But those are apps that probably need a larger number of people. The more substantial apps probably start to exist when you have 10X or even 100X the number of users. So today we have about 3000 people using Farcaster. It's a private beta, invite only, been really deliberate about growth. So maybe 10X or 100X from here, 30,000 to 300,000, that's where you start to get developers who go, okay, maybe it's actually worth me testing out this kind of weird social idea I have on this network because that gets them at least enough potential users that if you get 10% of them, now you at least have an early user base that you can play around. And as the overall protocol grows, I think that the sophistication of the apps will get more and more sophisticated. And I think the natural way to monetize for these different apps is as the network gets more scale, I think you're going to see naturally apps do free with ads or something. But I do think in the early days, and part of this might be a norm set by our client, we plan to use subscriptions as the primary way to do monetization because we actually think it aligns the values that we are hoping to have in terms of what the network should be as this kind of a little bit more sophisticated pro feeling network versus lowest common denominator scale of maybe some of the Web2 social networks. And the other nice thing is that it aligns how we build the product with what our users want versus how to get them to spend more time so they see more ads. So every subscriber we have, essentially you can think of it as like Amazon Prime, where what Amazon is constantly trying to do is they're trying to find other things that they can add to the Prime bundle that make Prime subscriptions that much more valuable to their subscriber. It's this kind of drive more value. Same thing for Netflix. Netflix is looking, how can we add better and more interesting content for the same price that we're charging for people? But that is a fundamentally different model than something like Facebook and Twitter. They have to keep users happy enough, but there's always that kind of tension where they can dial up the amount of ads in the feed or just do whatever they want because they're ultimately focused on time spent. A good example of this recently is Instagram because of TikTok is pushing Reels. The revealed preference, by the way, is people love out of feeds despite what people complain, but the push is a result of you were trying to actually compete in a zero sum world of time spent between TikTok and Instagram. And so doing the kind of change is you're focused on what gets our users to spend more time versus does this is actually what people want.

# From Coinbase Employee #20 to Building Farcaster with Dan Romero [nXsgSaM_vE8]_part4

And it's a hard thing because again, the reveal preferences people actually do like algo feeds, but I would say it's a slightly different model for us in that you can imagine that the average person is spending 10 minutes a day on Forecaster. We may actually launch a feature that maybe it's algorithmic, machine learning, or just filters that allow people to be more efficient in finding whatever they're looking for on Forecaster when they look at the feed, that it reduces the time spent from 10 minutes to nine minutes and 30 seconds. In an advertising based business, probably not a good thing, right? Because the amount of time you spend is probably how many correlates with how many ads you see. Whereas in a subscriber based business, you could argue that that is actually providing more value to the customer because now what they got is they got 30 seconds back as a result of it being higher signal or more efficient for them, right? So thinking of it as like a tool versus this kind of almost a competitor to television of like, we just want you to spend time here and then look at a bunch of ads, I think is something that we're gonna try to experiment with. But if it works, I do think it sets an ethos in the ecosystem, at least for the early adopters. And I think the more pro users, the people who are using the network as this kind of public intellectual social network that I bet you, if you could actually go back in time, if Twitter could choose a different monetization path, they probably would have done this instead of trying to kind of always be this Facebook that never has the same scale or the ability to do the targeting. And I actually think their business would be in a fine place today compared to basically it's a public company that has never made a single, like the total cumulative amount of profit is negative as a public company. And part of that is also that I think they're over staff. There's like 8,000 people that work there and you can't solve the spam bot problem. But part of that also might be a set of incentives is that you don't want top line numbers in an advertising based business to go down. Maybe a little cynical on that. But my point being is I think clients in a new ecosystem in 2022 may find success with subscriptions, thinking of themselves more as tools, accessing this kind of public social network, versus we need to kind of be this lock in and everything needs to be in the mothership. So that's one way I'm thinking about it. Okay, a couple more questions, how do we beat the bots? I tweeted this recently. I think Twitter could do this tomorrow if they really wanted to just take the hit on their total number of users. And I think we'll plan to do this with Merkle Manufactories clients. Phone number, credit card on file. So don't charge them, but maybe do a one-time charge of $1 till you have that. Coinbase, we asked for a passport so you could do another thing. And it should just be a set of steps, five steps to get verified. And that's how you get a blue check, not your celebrity or you work at some media organization or whatever, or maybe have two different types of checks. But I bet you a ton of people would go through the friction if they spent a lot of time on Twitter to get that check mark, especially if you could say, hey, the algorithm will boost anyone who's verified. And explicitly, we will not show replies from unverified people. You can use Twitter as an unverified way, like that's a consumption mechanism. But if you want to participate in the conversation, you need to go through a little bit of that. So to me, that's what we do at Merkle Manufactory and then you don't have bots. Plus it costs money to register a Forecaster username because there's a non-chain. Right, right. Are there, Akil BVS asks, are there any plans to roll out incentives to build on top of Forecaster to attract developers? What sort of new apps with social primitives slash use cases do you think builders can build? Well, the second part of that question is the, you know, world's your oyster. If I could invite every new social app, I would probably get to the new primitive to go after because it's a lot easier to grow if you have a viral new primitive. That said, I think incentives, that's something that we've tried a little bit. So we had a couple of people build early apps last, like, you know, in the spring, and we offered them kind of a one-time block grant, no strings attached for the summer. And just to kind of defrace over costs and encourage them to keep building the apps that they were doing. That worked pretty well. So I think that we probably will do something along those lines. I think what's important though, is people show organic interest. And there's no promises like, oh, if I build something, you're gonna give me a grant. It's more of a, you know, no, when you see a good faith effort, which maybe doesn't scale, but I think aligns you much more towards a organic community versus a strictly paid for mercenary community. So I think we want to avoid that part, but there's probably a pretty optimal trade off. And I think going back to the ideas, the one thing I think that I'm excited about is, one primitive that every user on Forecaster has, is a private key. So it's the first network that just by itself, you signing up for Forecaster username, you have a public and private key, even something like Signal, you have to actually verify with the phone number. And so you can imagine that the amount of encrypted or zero knowledge, if you want to get more technical in the crypto side, types of experiences that you can permissionlessly build as a developer, knowing that every single user on Forecaster in order for them to even be on Forecaster, have to have a private key that's hot, right? Live, I think is an idea space that someone will build something really interesting. And to use a framework that I think a lot of people talk about, generally social networks that succeed offer some new type of speech or new primitive that enables people to communicate in a new way. And I think that entire space of new encrypted experiences and new zero knowledge experiences is completely under tapped, partially because it's cutting edge technology, right? Like you have to really understand it. It has not been, there's no Ruby on Rails equivalent for ZK yet. And so I think it'll take some time for that to happen. Got it. We're way over, but I appreciate you staying a little bit longer, Dan. Before I let you go, how do we get a Forecaster invite? If those listening want to join and where can we find you? Yeah, so if you've made it this far, that's proof of work, proof of work enough that if you DM me on Twitter, DWR and mention you heard the podcast, I'm happy to send you an invite. I think we're really trying to be deliberate people who are thoughtful, optimistic, energetic. And if you spending time listening to a podcast, someone talking about what through social, you're probably a good candidate for Forecaster. Cool. Cool. Thank you so much. We'll have to do this again soon, but yeah, until next time. Cheers.

Hello everybody, welcome to another episode of Cross-Chain Examination. I'm your host, Katherine Wu. Each week on Cross-Chain Examination, we have on the smartest voices in the crypto industry to tell us what's top of mind for them. Decentralized social media, Web3 social, decentralized social graph, these are all part of a larger narrative that have trended lately in recent years in response to the increasing frustration with the walled garden model of traditional social networks, aka the ones we probably all use on a day-to-day basis currently. The frustration also stems from a lack of empowerment around your own user data and the way these walled gardens have evolved to no longer serve outside developers who may want to build on it. Given that the ethos of crypto is entirely based on optionality, user empowerment, can it be extended to social networks and platforms? With us today is Dan Romero, co-founder of the Farcaster Protocol, a, this is what I got from the website, sufficiently decentralized protocol that empowers developers to build novel social networks. We'll get to more of this in a bit. A little bit on Dan, he's one of the earliest crypto advocates having been the 20th employee at Coinbase. As a note, Coinbase is now a public company with over 4,000 employees. With as many years of experience and wealth of knowledge, I'm super excited to have him on today. And with that, welcome to the show, Dan. Thanks for having me. I'm super grateful for your time. And I think this is a really interesting topic. So let's dive in. As promised, let's start with dissecting the thesis behind Farcaster. So starting off with a super broad question, what is the main difference between the likes of Twitter, Reddit, and Farcaster? And in other words, why build Farcaster as a protocol versus a social network platform was just less restrictive APIs? So I think it's worth stepping back and thinking about the kind of first era of the internet, the more recent era of the internet, and kind of where we are headed. So the way to think about that, web one, you have the World Wide Web kicks off with Netscape. And the foundational protocols for most of the apps and services and websites that people were using were completely permissionless and open, right? So in the case of the web, the protocol underlying it is HTTP. And you have domain names, which run on DNS. And then in the case of email, you run on SMTP, right? Most users don't even know the underlying protocols. They think of the end use applications, right? So you use email, you use Gmail, or with the web, you just think of websites, right? And I don't think of Airbnb and Uber necessarily using the same thing, right? Because in many ways, you actually use an app on a phone. But all under the hood, the way the APIs and kind of these applications are built, they're using kind of open protocols that are completely permissionless. Airbnb didn't need to write in to get permission to start building Airbnb. Fast forward to kind of the web two era, and certain apps were built kind of in this open standard, but then other apps were built in a way that kind of ended up centralizing a lot of control. And actually, if you use those examples, Airbnb and Uber, they both are examples of apps that kind of have their own network effect, and you can only access Airbnb through Airbnb's app, right? And so in the web two era, all of the social networks that kind of ended up getting to scale have that similar effect. So if you think of Facebook, if you think of Twitter, YouTube, the kind of relationship between a user or a publisher, right? So if you put stuff on those social networks, and their audience is controlled by that centralized entity. And there are a whole bunch of reasons that that happened, the primary being that it actually offered a superior user experience. And so naturally, people use the best user experience, you kind of have these big centralizing forces. And that's why you have all these big networks. However, 2022, we are in an era where there's a lot of consternation that is kind of being directed at some of these platforms, where they're making decisions on whether it's content moderation, how the algorithm works, the feature set that you get to use. I think a most recent example is Instagram changed the way they do their feed to be more algorithmic like TikTok, and a whole bunch of high profile people and other users complained. And there's no way for those users to actually do something different. Actually, there was an app that launched called OG, that was meant to be just kind of the original experience of Instagram. And it was actually removed from the App Store because it was violating Instagram's terms of service. And so kind of all of those things have contributed, in my mind, to a need for moving social networking back to this kind of web one era of open protocols where you can build whatever you want. And you don't have to ask anyone for permission as a developer. And so Farcaster is kind of building on that in the way that it guarantees two things. The first is that a user who's publishing information on Farcaster has a direct relationship with their audience. And the example I always like to give is if you are publishing on Twitter or YouTube, and one of those platforms decides that they no longer want you on that platform, you don't get to export your audience, it just disappears overnight. So you could have spent 10 years building a big following on YouTube, they kick you off for whatever reason, right? Doesn't have to be political. You don't get a one last chance to get your followers, right? Contrast that to Substack, where it's built on top of email, which was one of those protocols I mentioned before. And Substack allows you, even if Substack were to kick you off Substack, which I don't think they generally do, you can export your email list. So that's a pretty neat feature of being built on kind of an open protocol like email. The second guarantee for Farcaster, and I think you brought it up at the beginning, is as a developer, I have direct access to the data and APIs of the underlying protocol. And in our case, because it's kind of this public social network, you can think of that as the social graph, the profiles, the posts, the likes, the follows. And that's important because if you actually look at the early era of social networking, and the two examples I'll bring up first is Facebook. Facebook had an app platform, Zynga being a pretty prominent company that had been built on top of that, that within a very short period of time, when Facebook changed their strategy, basically had a severe material impact on Zynga's business in terms of ability to monetize because of some decisions that Facebook made. And then similarly, in the early days of Twitter, Twitter didn't even have a mobile app. All of the mobile apps were third party. And at a certain point, around 2014, 2015, Twitter made a strategic decision that at the time probably made sense for their company, but had a big impact on all of these independent developers who had spent years building kind of applications in an ecosystem. So with a protocol based social network, like Forecaster, that's impossible, because developer always has the ability to directly access the underlying data and APIs, again, similar to the web or email. Yeah, there's a lot of good points I want to dissect there. I mean, first an anecdote, which is like, for creators and developers, and like basically users, which was like the three thing most important parts, I think, to like any like social app or network, and you want kind of all three sides to like developer wise, like, personally, I think it's a net good for your ecosystem for people to be able to build on it, use your API's and basically like built on top of that. I think like the web two companies probably disagree, the user side, obviously, your user is your lifeline. And then as a creator, like any social platform, you also need creators, right? Because what is there otherwise to consume? So creator aside from like being able to port their content, it's also being able to port their following. I don't know if you know the story, like I got into crypto, like super early days by starting this like little niche YouTube channel. I don't really talk about it because it's embarrassing. But like, now that I'm relaunching this podcast, and I'm kind of like going back to my account, I'm like, Oh, man, I actually built up like a very, very small, but like dedicated following kind of wish I could just like, put that over and now have to like start from zero again. So that's just like a minute, like problem on the creator side. But as you were talking about the difference between you know, web one with two like apps, any social apps built in the crypto space, I think one big difference is basically in order to like use any crypto apps or interact with crypto, you actually need to like own crypto first. And so like it for me to get online, I just need like a router and modem. But for crypto app, depending on what network they're built on, I also need to use the native token. And so I think like, sure, as the end user, I don't have to think about how email works. I don't need to know what protocol it's built on. But as a user, like to use a crypto app, I need to kind of know what the underlying network is so that I can like pay gas fees and like do these things like, at least in the current state. And so I guess going back to my original question, which is like, are there things that I guess like a token network can enable for Forecaster that like building in a web architecture can't? Yeah, so I think two things. So the first is, we take the kind of requirement that you need to have crypto in order to use an app pretty seriously in that we think that that is a bad user experience, particularly for something as kind of consumer oriented as social. It's one thing if you're using something like Coinbase, where you're investing in a cryptocurrency, it's kind of hard to not have to, you know, do all this onboarding and then ultimately connect your bank account so you can go buy because that's what you're trying to do there. Whereas with a social app, you're actually just trying to kind of like what content is here, who should I follow? And so that's a much lighter weight requirement in terms of at least interest. And so I think that the app experience should mimic that. And so one thing that we've done early days is use something called meta transactions. So when you onboard to Forecaster, we actually do the on-chain transaction for you. Yet the architecture is actually still done in a user controlled way, which I think is actually kind of cool. We use something called OpenGSN. But you can kind of think of it as the user creates a new wallet to sign up for Forecaster, but they didn't have to have any Ethereum to actually do that initial transaction, which puts the kind of core primitive, which is the only thing that we actually put on chain, which is the username, kind of your identity, and mapping that to an Ethereum address, which is a public key, which allows everything else in the network to be off-chain, really fast, easy to use, because under the hood, everything magically is being signed with that crypto wallet. So that's kind of been an important product experience that we've really tried to hone and improve over time. But to step back to say, what does a crypto powered network enable? I think a core primitive that we're starting to see some interesting initial applications pop up around is the fact that everyone on Forecaster, by definition, has to have a public and private key. And I think if you kind of go back to the history of some of these computing platforms, the early web, effectively, people made an assumption that everyone has an email address, right? To be on the web, you probably had an AOL account in the US at some point, and that came with an email address. And so one of the reasons email addresses became the authentication mechanism for virtually every website and app was because they were kind of universal. And as we shifted to mobile, you actually saw a shift from making an assumption that a user had an email address to, well, if you're on a mobile phone, you have a phone number by definition. And so actually, a lot of the kind of best in class mobile apps shifted over to an assumption that you just have a phone number. Upload your contact book to find friends, use that as authentication, right? It's like, it'll send you a text message so you can log in. And so I think where we're headed with Forecaster is we're actually adding a new primitive and a strong assumption you can make about anyone who is already onboarded to Forecaster. And we're doing a lot of the work to onboard the users to the protocol. But as a developer, you can actually make the assumption that any user within the Forecaster ecosystem has a public and private key. And with that, it's actually a canvas for a whole bunch of new ideas. An example being zero knowledge proofs is you can actually permissionlessly start to build new apps and experiences that make that assumption that a user has a public and private key that you can kind of start to create new experiences that otherwise would be very difficult to bootstrap. Yeah, it's the sign in Ethereum button that I'm hoping to see kind of like everywhere in a few years. Something that I've noticed about Forecaster also specifically, is I've seen a lot of developer excitement being attracted to build on it. And like, you know, I was looking at your feed this morning and you were like, Oh, I didn't realize like paragraph, which is like a web free newsletter, like integrated with Forecaster, like that's awesome for missionless innovation. And so I think those are like really encouraging early signs. And so as you kind of look at this, what metrics in your head do you think you need Forecaster to get to for you to consider it as hitting critical mass? The way I think about it is you start with what do we ultimately want to accomplish and we want to build an internet scale protocol. So you think of those core protocols that I mentioned at the beginning, DNS, HTTP, SMTP, I want Forecaster one day to be at that level, which is a pretty ambitious, big goal. And in order for us to get there, that by definition means we have a lot of developers building new apps and services on top of Forecaster, the protocol. And if you then kind of step back and say, well, how do you get a whole bunch of developers building on a protocol, at least from a social protocol, which is a little different than DeFi, and I've been in crypto for a while, and so I spent a lot of time trying to kind of think through this. What a social developer cares about is addressable daily active users. And the analogy I always like to give is the reason the app store on the iPhone is interesting for developers is not because of some fundamental technology breakthrough from the app store. If anything, it's actually kind of draconian. Obviously, the app store cut is limiting from a business model standpoint. But the reason people still deal with all of these app store restrictions is the fact that Apple has a billion people around the world, and they tend to be higher income people who have an iPhone and are carrying around with it on their physical person every day. So better than a daily active user, it's like daily active carry around a device that you're checking all the time. And so to kind of bring that back to Farcaster, the thing that's going to attract developers who want to build new apps and services is the total number of people who are using at least one Farcaster app every day. And so from our standpoint, the way to solve for that is build the first app, right? So you are the one that is doing a lot of the work for onboarding, figuring out, okay, where's kind of the friction on that onboarding process, but also what is a compelling feature set to get a sufficient number of people to be checking some app in the Farcaster ecosystem every single day, which now all of a sudden means an app developer who's building Paragraph or Pearl or any of these apps that are starting to get built in the Farcaster ecosystem, they have an addressable market of crypto curious, daily active users that they can make the assumption that they have an Ethereum wallet just based on the architecture. So if you're a web three or crypto builder, and you have a new app or service, even with Farcaster being much, much smaller than a traditional social network, all of a sudden that social graph becomes actually a great place to potentially go launch your product, because you know that the average quality of the user on a variety of metrics is higher. And that, I think, becomes the flywheel if we can continue to grow, again, the total number of daily active users, you attract more developers, those developers build new apps and services, which attract other people who want to try those out. And I think we're starting to see early signs of it. But I think we have a ways to go before it truly hits critical mass. And so to maybe give you a quantitative number, we have roughly 3000 people in our beta today for Farcaster, I would expect that it probably needs to be two orders of magnitude larger. So kind of in the hundreds of thousands of total people signed up on the network before I actually think that you've hit that critical mass where developers now are kind of thinking Farcaster first. And I think we're having some early signs of that today. But we have a ways to go before we truly get there. Yeah, if I'm not wrong, all 3000 users, you onboarded yourself. Yeah. So the first 400 I did a video call with, and actually, what's interesting is most of those people turned, maybe it's me, or maybe it was the wrong set of people to go after in the early days. And I think we've gotten a lot better about kind of figuring out who is actually going to be most interested in Farcaster at least today. And I think one set of features that we built last year that ended up working out pretty well is we natively integrated an NFT feed alongside the kind of Twitter-like experience. So in some ways, it's kind of hearkening back to the old school Facebook newsfeed, where you had posts, but you have all these kind of like, oh, this person changed their profile photo, etc. And in our case, it was taking what you were doing on chain and kind of mixing it with the kind of Farcaster native content, which looks a little bit more like Twitter. And I think we just kind of continued to iterate week over week over the last year. And at some point in the spring, we kind of hit an inflection point, I couldn't tell you exactly what happened other than the conversational liquidity on the app, and I follow everyone on the app, so I generally get a sense for what's going on. It got to a point where you could actually open up the app, and there's probably a new post within call every minute. And actually, we just hit that, that like from an actual threshold in September, we got to a point where on average, there were enough posts that every minute in the month of September, there was a new Farcaster post. And so the kind of feeling like this is actually now a vibrant community where there's actually stuff going on. That is the big driver of what's actually been I think, growing the network now, whereas maybe some of the features we had before were good enough to kind of bootstrap it. But actually, if I if I talked to anyone on Farcaster today, the primary reason they're using the network is they actually find that the people on the network and the conversations on the network are interesting in and of themselves. And so I think that that's an exciting stage for us, because it means we probably can continue to grow the network for some amount of time, where we don't have to necessarily add any one new feature. And it allows us to actually focus really in on keeping the community really high quality. And so you know, trying to avoid spam bots and all this other kind of stuff that I think plagued a lot of other social networks. And then similarly focus on the protocol. We made a decision last year when we launched the beta, we launched v1 of our protocol knowing full well, it wasn't going to scale and it wasn't going to be perfect. And we're in the process now of migrating from the first version of the protocol to the second version of the protocol with a year's worth of learning under our belt. And all the mistakes that we made were hopefully correcting and should reduce the number of kind of like pain points, especially for developer experience at the protocol level, informed by that kind of year's worth of usage. Yeah, I don't think I've heard the term conversation liquidity before. I think it's amazing. I think that's like, I don't know if you coined it, we're gonna make it a thing. So yeah, 3000 ish users, you get a cast every minute. So you're pretty much onboarding like early power users. And I've heard from a lot of people like, hey, forecasters amazing, because like a lot of the noise is gone, like people who are on it really care about what they're talking about. And so like, I mean, this is the obvious question with any social app, when you think about curation, which is very much like, you know, you heavy, which is quality versus quantity. So as you open up the beta, as you start to onboard more people, as it gets more quote, unquote, noisy, how do you think about that balance? So we're figuring it out, I don't claim to have a perfect solution, we plan to stay invite only first kind of in this model where it's DM me on Twitter to get access to the network. And a lot of people are doing the referrals, right? So it's someone telling a friend, they're showing at a conference, like, hey, look at this app. And then people DM me and say, I saw this, you know, a friend showed it to me. I think we need to move that to a community driven model like that, that's much more sustainable, just from the fact that I probably can't manage my DMS on Twitter, beyond much more than where we are today. But the goal is to actually for the first million users to keep it invite only. And we don't want to kind of go vertical in terms of the growth rate, because I actually think that can overwhelm the network. And so we're targeting something along the lines of 5% weekly growth, compounded over multiple years to kind of get there, maybe it ends up being a little higher, but that's still multiple years before we get to a million users. And I think that if we take that deliberate slow growth approach, assuming people continue to find the network useful, as we scale, we are going to run into inevitable issues around quality, the community feels like it's getting bigger and not as intimate as it was before. And I think it can really help force us on our product, right? Like we built this initial client. And if we continue to be active users of the network, how do we actually make the experience feel as intimate as it was when it was maybe smaller. And so I think part of that is just kind of paying attention, responding to user feedback, talking to users on a frequent basis, and then trying to kind of think about what are the smart defaults that we can set in the client, assuming we're going to continue to be one of the larger clients, that reward behavior on the network that we think is correlated with quality and the direction we want to head. And so one example I'll give you, we have the concept of a like on Farcaster, and we have the concept of a retweet, we call it a recast on Farcaster. But the very simple algorithmic feed, so we kind of have a normal reverse chronological feed, and then we have an algorithmic feed, we call it highlights. We have made an explicit decision that the highlights feed should highlight the most active and engaged conversations on the network, not necessarily the thing that has the highest like count, which I think if you strictly let a machine learning algorithm that was optimized towards time spent in engagement go wild, you inevitably are going to have the posts that get the most likes and recasts. But if you actually are kind of making a human level, hey, this is actually what we want to kind of nudge the community towards, it's still going to have its version of gaming and people trying to figure out how to hack the algorithm. But I think if you view the social network algorithm much more like a game developer would, and so to use the kind of term, there's this kind of term in games like Dota or League of Legends, where they nerf overpowered strategies, and then they buff the underpowered ones, assuming you kind of want to continue to add balance. I think that that's a mentality that we are hoping to bring as we grow towards that million users. And I think if we can actually make it to that point and still have a highly engaged and kind of active community, I think roughly around a million, you can actually open up signups and the product probably is more mature in that it can handle all the inevitable things that start to come with an open signup network. And I'm happy to talk about those because obviously as soon as you open it up to anyone on the internet, it gets a little messier. 100% Yeah, for sure. The messy part and I want to touch on the messy part, but to kind of respond to what you're saying, like I think even a million, that's a big number, but it can still be majority self selecting in terms of the people that are on the platform. Obviously being online, super beneficial in some ways building your brand, you know, meeting people that you otherwise would never meet across the world. All of that is the great stuff. But the really, really, really not great stuff is, you know, opens you up for harassment for bullying. And I think in recent years, it's just gotten especially, you know, you hear about certain platforms getting super toxic. And so I guess on an open platform, how would curation and moderation work if they do work? And can it work? Or is it just inherently at odds with the open nature of a decentralized social protocol? Yes, I think the analogy I would point to is email. Everyone in the world basically uses moderation in their email, they just call it spam filtering. And I don't think it tends to be that controversial because it tends to be pretty tuned to a specific type of email, right. But even if you think about Gmail, Gmail's default interface actually has multiple tabs, right. And if you think about kind of like what gets put in that primary tab that's effectively Gmail's algorithm, right. And if you're an ecommerce company, and you've built a relationship with the user, now Gmail is actually disintermediating you in terms of like the primary place of attention. And so I think that the way to think about moderation with something like Barcaster is going to take time to get multiple clients, right. So we only have one client today. But if you believe that we get to a world where we have multiple clients, then clients are going to be the ones that are the first line of moderation, right. And so our client that we're building might have a different moderation policy than another client, in the same way that there is no universal spam filter, it's based on the service provider that you choose. But what's important about that is as an adult, and a kind of a consumer, you have the choice of which client to use. And that, I think is a good market pressure towards allowing the clients to try to optimize for what they think is the best content moderation policy that still serves their set of customers, right. And I think you can also kind of think about that, even if all of the clients decide to kind of restrict access to a certain account, it truly reprehensible or terrible content that they're posting. And then if you actually look to the next layer down the kind of like Farcaster network, there's this concept that we have that are similar to Ethereum nodes called Farcaster hubs, you could have all of the hubs decide to say, hey, we're not going to index this content. You as that user still have one, your kind of username to pub key mapping, which lives on chain. And then two, you have the ability to go run your own hub, which to use another analogy is very similar to the web, right. If you think about it, when you have a website, Google is not guaranteeing that they're going to index it. And in fact, if it was really bad, they're probably not going to index it. But that doesn't mean that your website got taken down off of your web host, whether you're hosting it in your basement or paying another web host. But it does shift the distribution significantly in that you have to have a direct relationship with your audience, you're not going to get kind of free traffic from Google. And they'd have to have directly access your website via URL in a browser. And so I think of it like that, where if you remove the vertically integrated stack that exists in traditional social networking, which is identity, the hosting, the moderation, and the algorithm, which is essentially distribution, if each one of those is actually kind of a little bit more fragmented and a little bit more market based, I think you lower the temperature pretty quickly. Because if you take something like Twitter, fundamentally, Twitter's algorithm is optimizing for engagement and time spent. And I would imagine that posts that are incendiary tend to drive engagement. So outside of some manual review, generally, those posts are going to bubble up because it's getting a lot of engagement and people are spending time looking at it. Whereas if now you have an ecosystem of clients, different clients are going to have different optimizations. And I can tell you the client we intend to build, we're not going to do an ad based model, we're going to do subscription based models. So you can kind of almost thinking more like superhuman for social media, where our goal is actually to provide the highest signal to noise ratio for our subscribers. So that's a fundamentally at odds with time spent. So you could imagine there's like a Zen mode where it's like, don't show me the posts that are going to actually be abusive or all this other kind of stuff. Because we actually aren't trying to get engagement, what we're trying to do is provide you the subscriber with the most utility. Hmm. Yeah, I think that actually speaks to like a very common misconception, which is like, if it's open, it's inherently like chaotic. But I think what you're trying to say is actually the composability of it actually allows for more options, and more tailoring that's like suitable to each person, each user, or whatever. So I think that's an important like misconception actually to dispel. Yeah. And I think one other thing to think about, so I use this analogy, it's not perfect, but newspapers, they have their own editorial policies, what gets put on the front page is essentially an algorithm, it's human powered, right? In theory, they're all reporting on the same factual set of information, the stuff that's happening in the world, but coming at it from a very different lens, right? But because there's actual freedom of choice, and anyone can go start their own newspaper, obviously, you know, you need resources to do that. But because that's actually a competitive market, there isn't one algorithm that, oh, well, if it ends up on, you know, this newspaper, that's how everyone thinks it's there's actually a much bigger marketplace for good and for bad, right? Yeah. So I think a big percentage of our listeners are builders at Web3 companies. So putting out a wish list, what are some of the things that you want to see built using the protocol? I think I mentioned it before, I think zero knowledge proofs are this academic conceptual area, we've seen some major breakthroughs over the last few years, and, and they're kind of a technology looking for maybe a solution. But what I think is neat with Forecaster is now you actually have an engaged user base, and hopefully we continue to grow it that has a public and private key, it's an Ethereum address. And you can actually start to do applications using this kind of theoretical, interesting technology, and it should just be compatible directly with a Forecaster user. And so an example of this would be trustless decentralized polls, where if you think about when you vote on a poll on Twitter, you're actually voting, it's anonymous, but that's only anonymous, because Twitter's UI has shown it as anonymous in their database, they know what you voted for. So if that was ever leaked, maybe people would find that embarrassing. Whereas you can imagine with a zero knowledge trustless, decentralized poll, I can prove that I'm an active Forecaster user, I can prove that I only voted once, and I can prove that the original Forecaster account didn't create multiple, you know, kind of sock puppet accounts to do multiple votes. That's a difficult thing to actually go implement. But theoretically, that should be able to work with zero knowledge. And so you can imagine an application that now allows for one Forecaster account, one vote, which would be interesting. I think another thing that I'm just generally excited for is today, we really only have one client because we've been the one building kind of the protocol and the client. I think early next year, the developer experience at the protocol level is going to be sufficient enough that you're going to start to see people experiment with their own clients. And I think that that's really powerful, because one that gives the ability for anyone on our client today that's unhappy with whatever product decisions we make moderation policy, pick your reason for being upset with us, they now have a viable exit. And I think that's critically important to actually hitting a bar to say, hey, this is a sufficiently decentralized social network, right? Because I can talk to you blue in the face about the philosophy. But if the reality is the only way to access the network in a reasonable way is through one client, if that client decides to kick you off, then effectively, the network is no different than a centralized network. So I think it's really important that we get to that ecosystem of multiple clients. And I can imagine some people will build open source, some people will build closed source, subscription, ad based. I'm just excited that if there's actually starting to be a competing ecosystem of clients, it's going to raise the average quality of client, as well as benefit the network in a way that it hits that sufficient decentralization threshold. Yeah, and I'm excited to follow along. Last question is, where can people follow the work that you're doing? How to stay tuned if Forcaster opens up and sign up for it? Aside from spamming or DMS? They can send me a DM, I get through them every week, I get through all of them. It's DWR on Twitter. And I think just following the Twitter account, if you're not already in Forcaster, or there's a Forcaster Twitter account, if you're not on the network already, it's probably the easiest way to follow the progress. But hopefully we get to a place where we are doing more publishing on Forcaster and less on a centralized social network. But I think from a practical reality, it's where people are already spending time. And if you're spending time on Twitter, you're probably a good candidate to at least check out Forcaster because the experience today at least is very similar. Yeah, yeah. I have to say your response rate is astonishing fast. So ping DM Dan if you want to if you want an invite. Cool. Well, thank you so much for the discussion, Dan. I can't wait to follow along, have you maybe have you on again in a year just to see how it goes. And yeah, and thanks everyone for tuning in. Thanks for having me.

Hello everybody, welcome to another episode of cross-chain examination. I'm your host, Catherine Wu. Each week on cross-chain examination, we have on the smartest voices in the crypto industry to tell us what's top of mind for them. Decentralized social media, Web3 social, decentralized social graph, these are all part of a larger narrative that have trended lately in recent years in response to the increasing frustration with the walled garden model of traditional social networks, aka the ones we probably all use on a day-to-day basis currently. The frustration also stems from a lack of empowerment around your own user data and the way these walled gardens have evolved to no longer serve outside developers who may want to build on it. Given that the ethos of crypto is entirely based on optionality, user empowerment, can it be extended to social networks and platforms? With us today is Dan Romero, co-founder of the Farcaster Protocol, a, this is what I got from the website, sufficiently decentralized protocol that empowers developers to build novel social networks. We'll get to more of this in a bit. A little bit on Dan, he's one of the earliest crypto advocates having been the 20th employee at Coinbase. As a note, Coinbase is now a public company with over 4,000 employees. With as many years of experience and wealth of knowledge, I'm super excited to have him on today. And with that, welcome to the show, Dan. Thanks for having me. I'm super grateful for your time. And I think this is a really interesting topic. So let's dive in. As promised, let's start with dissecting the thesis behind Farcaster. So starting off with a super broad question, what is the main difference between the likes of Twitter, Reddit, and Farcaster? And in other words, why build Farcaster as a protocol versus a social network platform was just less restrictive APIs? So I think it's worth stepping back and thinking about the kind of first era of the internet, the more recent era of the internet, and kind of where we are headed. So the way to think about that, web one, you have the World Wide Web kicks off with Netscape. And the foundational protocols for most of the apps and services and websites that people were using were completely permissionless and open, right? So in the case of the web, the protocol underlying it is HTTP. And you have domain names, which run on DNS. And then in the case of email, you run on SMTP, right? Most users don't even know the underlying protocols. They think of the end use applications, right? So you use email, you use Gmail, or with the web, you just think of websites, right? And I don't think of Airbnb and Uber necessarily using the same thing, right? Because in many ways, you actually use an app on a phone. But all under the hood, the way the APIs and kind of these applications are built, they're using kind of open protocols that are completely permissionless. Airbnb didn't need to write in to get permission to start building Airbnb. Fast forward to kind of the web two era, and certain apps were built kind of in this open standard, but then other apps were built in a way that kind of ended up centralizing a lot of control. And actually, if you use those examples, Airbnb and Uber, they both are examples of apps that kind of have their own network effect, and you can only access Airbnb through Airbnb's app, right? And so in the web two era, all of the social networks that kind of ended up getting to scale have that similar effect. So if you think of Facebook, if you think of Twitter, YouTube, the kind of relationship between a user or a publisher, right? So if you put stuff on those social networks, and their audience is controlled by that centralized entity. And there are a whole bunch of reasons that that happened, the primary being that it actually offered a superior user experience. And so naturally, people use the best user experience, you kind of have these big centralizing forces. And that's why you have all these big networks. However, 2022, we are in an era where there's a lot of consternation that is kind of being directed at some of these platforms, where they're making decisions on whether it's content moderation, how the algorithm works, the feature set that you get to use. I think a most recent example is Instagram changed the way they do their feed to be more algorithmic like TikTok, and a whole bunch of high profile people and other users complained. And there's no way for those users to actually do something different. Actually, there was an app that launched called OG, that was meant to be just kind of the original experience of Instagram. And it was actually removed from the App Store because it was violating Instagram's terms of service. And so kind of all of those things have contributed in my mind to a need for moving social networking back to this kind of web one era of open protocols where you can build whatever you want. And you don't have to ask anyone for permission as a developer. And so Farcaster is kind of building on that in the way that it guarantees two things. The first is that a user who's publishing information on Farcaster has a direct relationship with their audience. And the example I always like to give is if you are publishing on Twitter or YouTube, and one of those platforms decides that they no longer want you on that platform, you don't get to export your audience, it just disappears overnight. So you could have spent 10 years building a big following on YouTube, they kick you off for whatever reason, right? Doesn't have to be political. You don't get a one last chance to get your followers, right? Contrast that to Substack, where it's built on top of email, which was one of those protocols I mentioned before. And Substack allows you even if Substack were to kick you off Substack, which I don't think they generally do, you can export your email list. So that's a pretty neat feature of being built on kind of an open protocol like email. The second guarantee for Farcaster, and I think you brought it up at the beginning, is as a developer, I have direct access to the data and APIs of the underlying protocol. And in our case, because it's kind of this public social network, you can think of that as the social graph, the profiles, the posts, the likes, the follows. And that's important because if you actually look at the early era of social networking, and the two examples I'll bring up first is Facebook. Facebook had an app platform, Zynga being a pretty prominent company that had been built on top of that, that within a very short period of time when Facebook changed their strategy, basically had a severe material impact on Zynga's business in terms of ability to monetize because of some decisions that Facebook made. And then similarly, in the early days of Twitter, Twitter didn't even have a mobile app. All of the mobile apps were third party. And at a certain point, around 2014, 2015, Twitter made a strategic decision that at the time probably made sense for their company, but had a big impact on all of these independent developers who had spent years building kind of applications in an ecosystem. So with a protocol based social network, like Forecaster, that's impossible, because developer always has the ability to directly access the underlying data and APIs, again, similar to the web or email. Yeah, there's a lot of good points I want to dissect there. I mean, first an anecdote, which is like, for creators and developers, and like basically users, which was like the three thing most important parts, I think, to like any like social app or network, and you want kind of all three sides to like developer wise, like, personally, I think it's a net good for your ecosystem for people to be able to build on it, use your API's and basically like built on top of that. I think like the web two companies probably disagree, the user side, obviously, your users, your lifeline. And then as a creator, like any social platform, you also need creators, right? Because what is there otherwise to consume? So creator aside from like being able to port their content, it's also being able to port their following. I don't know if you know the story, like I got into crypto, like super early days by starting this like little niche YouTube channel. I don't really talk about it because it's embarrassing. But like, now that I'm relaunching this podcast, and I'm kind of like going back to my account, I'm like, Oh, man, I actually built up like a very, very small, but like dedicated following kind of wish I could just like, put that over and now have to like start from zero again. So that's just like a minute, like problem on the creator side. But as you were talking about the difference between you know, web one with two like apps, versus any social apps built in the crypto space, I think one big difference is basically in order to like use any crypto apps or interact with crypto, you actually need to like own crypto first. And so like it for me to get online, I just need like a router and modem. But for a crypto app, depending on what network they're built on, I also need to use the native token. And so I think like, sure, as the end user, I don't have to think about how email works. I don't need to know what protocol it's built on. But as a user, like to use a crypto app, I need to kind of know what the underlying network is so that I can like pay gas fees and like do these things like, at least in the current state. And so I guess going back to my original question, which is like, are there things that I guess like a token network can enable for Forecaster that like building in a web architecture can't? Yeah, so I think two things. So the first is, we take the kind of requirement that you need to have crypto in order to use an app pretty seriously in that we think that that is a bad user experience, particularly for something as kind of consumer oriented as social. It's one thing if you're using something like Coinbase, where you're investing in a cryptocurrency, it's kind of hard to not have to, you know, do all this onboarding and then ultimately connect your bank account so you can go buy because that's what you're trying to do there. Whereas with a social app, you're actually just trying to kind of like what content is here? Who should I follow? And so that's a much lighter weight requirement in terms of at least interest. And so I think that the app experience should mimic that. And so one thing that we've done early days is use something called meta transactions. So when you onboard to Forecaster, we actually do the on-chain transaction for you. Yet the architecture is actually still done in a user controlled way, which I think is actually kind of cool. We use something called OpenGSN. But you can kind of think of it as the user creates a new wallet to sign up for Forecaster, but they didn't have to have any Ethereum to actually do that initial transaction, which puts the kind of core primitive, which is the only thing that we actually put on chain, which is the username, kind of your identity, and mapping that to an Ethereum address, which is a public key, which allows everything else in the network to be off-chain, really fast, easy to use, because under the hood, everything magically is being signed with that crypto wallet. So that's kind of been an important product experience that we've really tried to hone and improve over time. But to step back to say, what does a crypto powered network enable? I think a core primitive that we're starting to see some interesting initial applications pop up around is the fact that everyone on Forecaster, by definition, has to have a public and private key. And I think if you kind of go back to the history of some of these computing platforms, the early web, effectively, people made an assumption that everyone has an email address, right? To be on the web, you probably had an AOL account in the US at some point, and that came with an email address. And so one of the reasons email addresses became the authentication mechanism for virtually every website and app was because they were kind of universal. And as we shifted to mobile, you actually saw a shift from making an assumption that a user had an email address to, well, if you're on a mobile phone, you have a phone number by definition. And so actually, a lot of the kind of best in class mobile apps shifted over to an assumption that you just have a phone number. Upload your contact book to find friends, use that as authentication, right? It's like, it'll send you a text message so you can log in. And so I think where we're headed with Forecaster is we're actually adding a new primitive and a strong assumption you can make about anyone who is already onboarded to Forecaster. And we're doing a lot of the work to onboard the users to the protocol. But as a developer, you can actually make the assumption that any user within the Forecaster ecosystem has a public and private key. And with that, it's actually a canvas for a whole bunch of new ideas. An example being zero knowledge proofs is you can actually permissionlessly start to build new apps and experiences that make that assumption that a user has a public and private key that you can kind of start to create new experiences that otherwise would be very difficult to bootstrap. Yeah, it's the sign in Ethereum button that I'm hoping to see kind of like everywhere in a few years. Something that I've noticed about Forecaster also specifically, is I've seen a lot of developer excitement being attracted to build on it. And like, you know, I was looking at your feed this morning and you were like, Oh, I didn't realize like paragraph, which is like a web free newsletter, like integrated with Forecaster, like that's awesome for missionless innovation. And so I think those are like really encouraging early signs. And so as you kind of look at this, what metrics in your head do you think you need Forecaster to get to for you to consider it as hitting critical mass? The way I think about it is you start with what do we ultimately want to accomplish and we want to build an internet scale protocol. So you think of those core protocols that I mentioned at the beginning, DNS, HTTP, SMTP, I want Forecaster one day to be at that level, which is a pretty ambitious, big goal. And in order for us to get there, that by definition means we have a lot of developers building new apps and services on top of Forecaster, the protocol. And if you then kind of step back and say, well, how do you get a whole bunch of developers building on a protocol, at least from a social protocol, which is a little different than DeFi, and I've been in crypto for a while, and so I spent a lot of time trying to kind of think through this. What a social developer cares about is addressable daily active users. And the analogy I always like to give is the reason the app store on the iPhone is interesting for developers is not because of some fundamental technology breakthrough from the app store. If anything, it's actually kind of draconian. Obviously, the app store cut is limiting from a business model standpoint. But the reason people still deal with all of these app store restrictions is the fact that Apple has a billion people around the world, and they tend to be higher income people who have an iPhone and are carrying around with it on their physical person every day. So better than a daily active user, it's like daily active carry around a device that you're checking all the time. And so to kind of bring that back to Farcaster, the thing that's going to attract developers who want to build new apps and services is the total number of people who are using at least one Farcaster app every day. And so from our standpoint, the way to solve for that is build the first app, right? So you are the one that is doing a lot of the work for onboarding, figuring out, okay, where's kind of the friction on that onboarding process, but also what is a compelling feature set to get a sufficient number of people to be checking some app in the Farcaster ecosystem every single day, which now all of a sudden means an app developer who's building Paragraph or Pearl or any of these apps that are starting to get built in the Farcaster ecosystem, they have an addressable market of crypto curious, daily active users that they can make the assumption that they have an Ethereum wallet just based on the architecture. So if you're a web three or crypto builder, and you have a new app or service, even with Farcaster being much, much smaller than a traditional social network, all of a sudden that social graph becomes actually a great place to potentially go launch your product, because you know that the average quality of the user on a variety of metrics is higher. And that, I think, becomes the flywheel if we can continue to grow, again, the total number of daily active users, you attract more developers, those developers build new apps and services, which attract other people who want to try those out. And I think we're starting to see early signs of it. But I think we have a ways to go before it truly hits critical mass. And so to maybe give you a quantitative number, we have roughly 3000 people in our beta today for Farcaster, I would expect that it probably needs to be two orders of magnitude larger. So kind of in the hundreds of thousands of total people signed up on the network before I actually think that you've hit that critical mass where developers now are kind of thinking Farcaster first. And I think we're having some early signs of that today. But we have a ways to go before we truly get there. Yeah, if I'm not wrong, all 3000 users, you onboarded yourself. Yeah. So the first 400 I did a video call with, and actually, what's interesting is most of those people turned, maybe it's me, or maybe it was the wrong set of people to go after in the early days. And I think we've gotten a lot better about kind of figuring out who is actually going to be most interested in Farcaster at least today. And I think one set of features that we built last year that ended up working out pretty well is we natively integrated an NFT feed alongside the kind of Twitter-like experience. So in some ways, it's kind of hearkening back to the old school Facebook newsfeed, where you had posts, but you have all these kind of like, oh, this person changed their profile photo, etc. And in our case, it was taking what you were doing on chain and kind of mixing it with the kind of Farcaster native content, which looks a little bit more like Twitter. And I think we just kind of continued to iterate week over week over the last year. And at some point in the spring, we kind of hit an inflection point, I couldn't tell you exactly what happened other than the conversational liquidity on the app, and I follow everyone on the app, so I generally get a sense for what's going on. It got to a point where you could actually open up the app, and there's probably a new post within call every minute. And actually, we just hit that, that like from an actual threshold in September, we got to a point where on average, there were enough posts that every minute in the month of September, there was a new Farcaster post. And so the kind of feeling like this is actually now a vibrant community where there's actually stuff going on. That is the big driver of what's actually been I think, growing the network now, whereas maybe some of the features we had before were good enough to kind of bootstrap it. But actually, if I if I talked to anyone on Farcaster today, the primary reason they're using the network is they actually find that the people on the network and the conversations on the network are interesting in and of themselves. And so I think that that's an exciting stage for us, because it means we probably can continue to grow the network for some amount of time, where we don't have to necessarily add any one new feature. And it allows us to actually focus really in on keeping the community really high quality. And so you know, trying to avoid spam bots and all this other kind of stuff that I think plagued a lot of other social networks. And then similarly focus on the protocol. We made a decision last year when we launched the beta, we launched v1 of our protocol knowing full well it wasn't going to scale and it wasn't going to be perfect. And we're in the process now of migrating from the first version of the protocol to the second version of the protocol with a year's worth of learning under our belt. And all the mistakes that we made, we're hopefully correcting and should reduce the number of kind of like pain points, especially for developer projects.

# Future of Social Networks with Dan Romero of Farcaster [4YGu0T2tGT8]_part2

experience at the protocol level, informed by that kind of year's worth of usage. Yeah, I don't think I've heard the term conversation liquidity before. I think it's amazing. I think that's like, I don't know if you coined it, but we're going to make it a thing. So yeah, 3000-ish users, you get a cast every minute. So you're pretty much onboarding like early power users. And I've heard from a lot of people like, hey, Farcaster's amazing because like a lot of the noise is gone, like people who are on it really care about what they're talking about. And so like, I mean, this is the obvious question with any social app, when you think about curation, which is very much like, you know, you heavy, which is quality versus quantity. So as you open up the beta, as you start to onboard more people, as it gets more quote unquote noisy, how do you think about that balance? So we're figuring it out. I don't claim to have a perfect solution. We plan to stay invite only. First, kind of in this model where it's DM me on Twitter to get access to the network. And a lot of people are doing the referrals, right? So it's someone telling a friend, they're showing it at a conference, like, hey, look at this app. And then people DM me and say, I saw this, you know, a friend showed it to me. I think we need to move that to a community driven model. Like that's much more sustainable just from the fact that I probably can't manage my DMs on Twitter beyond much more than where we are today. But the goal is to actually for the first million users to keep it invite only. And we don't wanna kind of go vertical in terms of the growth rate, because I actually think that can overwhelm the network. And so we're targeting something along the lines of 5% weekly growth, compounded over multiple years to kind of get there. Maybe it ends up being a little higher, but that's still multiple years before we get to a million users. And I think that if we take that deliberate slow growth approach, assuming people continue to find the network useful, as we scale, we are going to run into inevitable issues around quality, the community feels like it's getting bigger and not as intimate as it was before. And I think it can really help force us on our product, right, like we built this initial client. And if we continue to be active users of the network, how do we actually make the experience feel as intimate as it was when it was maybe smaller? And so I think part of that is just kind of paying attention, responding to user feedback, talking to users on a frequent basis, and then trying to kind of think about what are the smart defaults that we can set in the client, assuming we're gonna continue to be one of the larger clients, that reward behavior on the network that we think is correlated with quality and the direction we wanna head. And so one example I'll give you, we have the concept of a like on Farcaster, and we have the concept of a retweet, we call it a recast on Farcaster. But the very simple algorithmic feed, so we kind of have a normal reverse chronological feed, and then we have an algorithmic feed, we call it highlights. We have made an explicit decision that the highlights feed should highlight the most active and engaged conversations on the network, not necessarily the thing that has the highest like count, which I think if you strictly let a machine learning algorithm that was optimized towards time spent in engagement go wild, you inevitably are going to have the posts that get the most likes and recasts. But if you actually are kind of making a human level, hey, this is actually what we wanna kind of nudge the community towards, it's still gonna have its version of gaming and people trying to figure out how to hack the algorithm. But I think if you view the social network algorithm much more like a game developer would, and so to use the kind of term, there's this kind of term in games like a Dota or League of Legends where they nerf overpowered strategies and then they buff the underpowered ones, assuming you kind of wanna continue to add balance. I think that that's a mentality that we are hoping to bring as we grow towards that million users. And I think if we can actually make it to that point and still have a highly engaged and kind of active community, I think roughly around a million, you can actually open up signups and the product probably is more mature in that it can handle all the inevitable things that start to come with an open signup network. And I'm happy to talk about those because obviously as soon as you open it up to anyone on the internet, it gets a little messier. 100%, yeah, for sure the messy part. And I wanna touch on the messy part, but to kind of respond to what you're saying, like I think even a million, that's a big number, but it can still be majority self-selecting in terms of the people that are on the platform. Obviously being online, super beneficial in some ways, building your brand, meeting people that you otherwise would never meet across the world. All of that is the great stuff, but the really, really, really not great stuff is opens you up for harassment, for bullying. And I think in recent years, it's just gotten, especially you hear about certain platforms getting super toxic. And so I guess on an open platform, how would curation and moderation work? If they do work and can it work, or is it just inherently at odds with the open nature of a decentralized social protocol? Yeah, so I think the analogy I would point to is email. Everyone in the world basically uses moderation in their email, they just call it spam filtering. And I don't think it tends to be that controversial because it tends to be pretty tuned to a specific type of email, right? But even if you think about Gmail, Gmail's default interface actually has multiple tabs, right? And if you think about kind of like what gets put in that primary tab, that's effectively Gmail's algorithm, right, and if you're an e-commerce company and you've built a relationship with a user, now Gmail is actually disintermediating you in terms of like the primary place of attention. And so I think that the way to think about moderation with something like Barcaster is going to take time to get multiple clients, right? So we only have one client today, but if you believe that we get to a world where we have multiple clients, then clients are going to be the ones that are the first line of moderation, right? And so our client that we're building might have a different moderation policy than another client in the same way that there is no universal spam filter, it's based on the service provider that you choose. But what's important about that is as an adult and a kind of a consumer, you have the choice of which client to use. And that I think is a good market pressure towards allowing the clients to try to optimize for what they think is the best content moderation policy that still serves their set of customers, right? And I think you can also kind of think about that even if all of the clients decide to kind of restrict access to a certain account, truly reprehensible or terrible content that they're posting. And then if you actually look to the next layer down, the kind of like Farcaster network, there's this concept that we have that are similar to Ethereum nodes called Farcaster hubs. You could have all of the hubs decide to say, hey, we're not gonna index this content. You as that user still have one, your kind of username to pub key mapping, which lives on chain. And then two, you have the ability to go run your own hub, which to use another analogy is very similar to the web, right? If you think about it, when you have a website, Google is not guaranteeing that they're gonna index it. And in fact, if it was really bad, they're probably not going to index it. But that doesn't mean that your website got taken down off of your web host, whether you're hosting it in your basement or paying another web host. But it does shift the distribution significantly in that you have to have a direct relationship with your audience. You're not gonna get kind of free traffic from Google and they'd have to have directly access your website via URL in a browser. And so I think of it like that, where if you remove the vertically integrated stack that exists in traditional social networking, which is identity, the hosting, the moderation and the algorithm, which is essentially distribution, if each one of those is actually kind of a little bit more fragmented and a little bit more market-based, I think you lower the temperature pretty quickly because if you take something like Twitter, fundamentally Twitter's algorithm is optimizing for engagement and time spent. And I would imagine that posts that are incendiary tend to drive engagement. So outside of some manual review, generally those posts are gonna bubble up because it's getting a lot of engagement and people are spending time looking at it. Whereas if now you have an ecosystem of clients, different clients are gonna have different optimizations. And I can tell you the client we intend to build, we're not gonna do an ad-based model, we're gonna do subscription-based models. So you can kind of almost thinking more like superhuman for social media, where our goal is actually to provide the highest signal-to-noise ratio for our subscribers. So that's a fundamentally at odds with time spent. So you could imagine there's like a Zen mode where it's like, don't show me the posts that are gonna actually be abusive or all this other kind of stuff, because we actually aren't trying to get engagement. What we're trying to do is provide you, the subscriber, with the most utility. Yeah, I think that actually speaks to like a very common misconception, which is like, if it's open, it's inherently like chaotic. But I think what you're trying to say is actually the composability of it actually allows for more options and more tailoring that's like suitable to each person, each user or whatever. So I think that's an important misconception actually to dispel. Yeah, and I think one other thing to think about, so I use this analogy, it's not perfect, but newspapers, they have their own editorial policies. What gets put on the front page is essentially an algorithm. It's human powered, right? In theory, they're all reporting on the same factual set of information, the stuff that's happening in the world, but coming at it from a very different lens, right? But because there's actual freedom of choice and anyone can go start their own newspaper, obviously, you need resources to do that. But because that's actually a competitive market, there isn't one algorithm that, oh, well, if it ends up on this newspaper, that's how everyone thinks. There's actually a much bigger marketplace for good and for bad, right? Yeah, so I think a big percentage of our listeners are builders at Web3 companies. So putting out a wishlist, what are some of the things that you wanna see built using the protocol? I think I mentioned it before, I think zero knowledge proofs are this academic, conceptual area that we've seen some major breakthroughs over the last few years in, and they're kind of a technology looking for maybe a solution. But what I think is neat with Forecaster is now you actually have an engaged user base, and hopefully we continue to grow it, that has a public and private key, it's an Ethereum address, and you can actually start to do applications using this kind of theoretical, interesting technology, and it should just be compatible directly with a Forecaster user. And so an example of this would be trustless decentralized polls, where if you think about when you vote on a poll on Twitter, you're actually voting, it's anonymous, but that's only anonymous because Twitter's UI has shown it as anonymous in their database, they know what you voted for. So if that was ever leaked, maybe people would find that embarrassing. Whereas you can imagine with a zero knowledge, trustless decentralized poll, I can prove that I'm an active Forecaster user, I can prove that I only voted once, and I can prove that the original Forecaster account didn't create multiple, you know, kind of sock puppet accounts to do multiple votes. That's a difficult thing to actually go implement, but theoretically that should be able to work with zero knowledge. And so you can imagine an application that now allows for one Forecaster account, one vote, which would be interesting. I think another thing that I'm just generally excited for is today we really only have one client because we've been the one building kind of the protocol and the client. I think early next year, the developer experience at the protocol level is gonna be sufficient enough that you're gonna start to see people experiment with their own clients. And I think that that's really powerful because one, that gives the ability for anyone on our client today that's unhappy with whatever product decisions we make, moderation policy, pick your reason for being upset with us, they now have a viable exit. And I think that's critically important to actually hitting a bar to say, hey, this is a sufficiently decentralized social network, right? Because I can talk to you blue in the face about the philosophy, but if the reality is the only way to access the network in a reasonable way is through one client, if that client decides to kick you off, then effectively the network is no different than a centralized network. So I think it's really important that we get to that ecosystem of multiple clients. And I can imagine some people will build open source, some people will build closed source, subscription, ad-based. I'm just excited that if there's actually starting to be a competing ecosystem of clients, it's going to raise the average quality of client as well as benefit the network in a way that it hits that sufficient decentralization threshold. Yeah, and I'm excited to follow along. Last question is where can people follow the work that you're doing? How to stay tuned if Farcaster opens up and sign up for it? Aside from spamming or DMs? They can send me a DM. I get through them every week. I get through all of them. It's DWR on Twitter. And I think just following the Twitter account, if you're not already in Farcaster or there's a Farcaster Twitter account, if you're not on the network already, it's probably the easiest way to follow the progress. But hopefully we get to a place where we are doing more publishing on Farcaster and less on a centralized social network. But I think from a practical reality, it's where people are already spending time. And if you're spending time on Twitter, you're probably a good candidate to at least check out Farcaster because the experience today at least is very similar. Yeah, yeah. I have to say your response rate is astonishing fast. So ping, DM Dan if you want an invite. Cool. Well, thank you so much for the discussion, Dan. I can't wait to follow along, have you maybe have you on again in a year just to see how it goes. And yeah, and thanks everyone for tuning in. Thanks for having me.

# How Farcaster can take over centralized social networks ｜ Dan Romero [_kdjry8w0dA]_part1

why sufficiently decentralized instead of completely centralized or completely decentralized? Yeah, so maybe just start with the issues of a centralized network or a completely decentralized network. So if we start with the centralized network problems, I mean, I'm sure your audience will know that there have been a bunch of problems with centralized social media companies over the last few years. You may have varying opinions on them. There's a lot of political spin on either side of that. But I think you could get a universal consensus that they're not perfect. And so there's room for improvement. And I think the challenge with centralized social networks is... Hello, everyone. Today, I'm here with Dan Romero. He's really into crypto. He was the VP of product at Coinbase and now he's the co-founder of ParkCaster, a sufficiently decentralized social network. I want to start a little bit with an overview of what's ParkCaster and what it means to be a sufficiently decentralized social network. So first of all, thanks for having me. The way I describe ParkCaster is it's a new type of social network and it's a social network where you as a user control your identity and can bring that identity between any application that you want to use. And that actually helps define the social network. It helps define the term that we use, sufficient decentralization, where I think a lot of people, when they think about centralization versus decentralization, you kind of have your classic Web2 companies, Facebook, Twitter on the Web2 side as the centralized options. And then you have the kind of extreme decentralized options, something like secure scuttlebutt, Mastodon being actually something that's probably in between and so may actually meet some threshold of sufficiently decentralized. But our point of view is actually when you want to build something that is more decentralized, not to start with the most extreme decentralized architecture, it's actually start with the centralized architecture because the revealed preference of consumers is they like using those apps. They have hundreds of millions, if not billions of users. And so you want to start with the user experience of a centralized application and then work to remove parts of the app that are centralized and kind of prevent, you know, the ability to exit the app with interoperability or the ability to switch to whatever client that you want and change the parts of the underlying architecture to be more decentralized on those parts. And so in the case of Forecaster, the app that you may use today looks a lot like Twitter. And in a lot of ways, a lot of the same infrastructure where we're running a lot of the like kind of feed generation infrastructure, the notification infrastructure on centralized servers, just like Twitter would be. But the core identity primitive is something that lives on the Ethereum blockchain and lives outside of the infrastructure that our company has. So that means if for whatever reason you didn't want to use our app anymore, you would be able to go use an app from another developer and everything would work completely as normal. Contrast that to something like Twitter or YouTube today. So you're on Twitter, you have a million followers, Twitter decides to remove your account, you don't get a chance to export your followers. There is no recourse. You can't go to court to say, I need to be reinstated Twitter. Twitter is a private company. They can do whatever they want. Same thing with YouTube. And contrast that in Web2 also to something like Substack, where I can build an audience with Substack. I, as the kind of creator or the publisher, own my email list. And so in the case that Substack for whatever reason didn't want to work with me, and they're generally actually pretty permissive of a wide variety of viewpoints, so I'm not picking on Substack, but I'm pointing out that whether it's Substack or myself as the publisher want to move, I can move to a different email newsletter provider, whether that's the centralized one, or I can run my own server. And the important thing is my audience doesn't know any different, right? Like they can still receive an email the next week, and it all works because email is built on top of decentralized protocols like DNS and email. And so to bring it all back to the beginning, what we're trying to do with Farcaster is we're trying to build something that's similar to email or DNS, but specifically for social, in that it's a low-level primitive that any developer can actually go build on top of, and then you as the user have the freedom to move between any application that you see fit. Awesome. So let's go into a little bit more detail what it means to be decentralized. So you mentioned that the identity is decentralized. What does it mean for identity to be decentralized? Is the social graph as well sitting on the Ethereum blockchain, or what is sitting on the blockchain? Is it the FID, or can you go into a little bit more detail? Yeah. So the core thing that with a network like Twitter, so kind of a public broadcast network where the ability to follow another user or subscribe to another user on the network is not permissioned. So on a network like Facebook or LinkedIn, if I want to connect with you, that's a bidirectional relationship. I'm making a friend request or a LinkedIn request, and then the other party needs to accept that. Twitter, for all intents and purposes, the default type of Twitter account is public. Everything is public about it. So all of the posts are public, all of the likes are public, who follows whom is public. I can follow you. You don't have to follow me back. And that's just how the network works, right? So in that case, the thing that is actually most critical to decentralization, so the easiest way to actually think about this is from a first principle standpoint is just think about what happens if you have that million followers on Twitter and you get kicked off of Twitter. What is, if you were to force rank all the things that you care about, your old tweets, your direct messages, your likes, none of those things actually matter relative to the fact that what you had achieved prior to being kicked off something like Twitter was you had a million people, all distributed around, who had indicated in a piece of software that any time I post to this network, please show me that content, right? So if you think about that, that can be boiled down to as a simple, there is a pointer somewhere that says content from X person lives here. And then whatever software they're using can actually go and try to retrieve that. And so if you're a little bit older school on the side of things like RSS is basically that, right? So I have a blog, I can have an RSS feed, I let someone subscribe to that. And then when they open up their RSS reader, the way that that architecture works is the RSS reader would go, okay, danromero.org slash RSS, I'm going to go check to see if there are any new posts. And in doing so, what you've effectively said is the critical thing is to have an ever present pointer for me as a publisher that I can have that people know what I'm doing and know where to find. So there's some version of an identity, and then it kind of points to where the content exists. And so that's essentially what we focused on for decentralization with Farcaster because that means no matter what application you're using, as long as it's properly authenticated, as you can prove that it is actually coming from me or from you, then the content can actually go out to the Farcaster protocol and then any application can pull it in and then verify that it actually did indeed come from the person that says, you know, who they said that we're coming from. So I think the way I think about that is if you just focus on the thing that needs the most effort on decentralization, then the rest of the experiences can actually be more centralized if that's actually what's going to offer users a better user experience. And so as a result of that, where we've put the most effort is this identity primitive, there's a middle layer where the content actually lives. And that's something we call Farcaster hubs, which we're actually still kind of in the process of building out, where you can kind of think of it as a blockchain without cryptocurrency. And in some ways, you don't need the kind of security guarantees of it because what you've actually done is you've put the canonical identity for this network on chain, right? Dan is this Ethereum address. And as a result of that Ethereum address being a public key, any piece of content that ends up on the kind of like Farcaster content network, the hubs, can be signed with the private key that maps to the public key that's on chain. And then any user has a very easy chain of trust of, okay, this is claiming to be from Dan. I'm going to check the signature. Does the signature match the pub key that is on the Ethereum blockchain? Yes. Okay, great. Then the content works. Obviously, no one is individually doing that. But the system is architected in a way that this can all automatically happen behind the scenes. And for the end user, all they see is they have high trust that the content that they see in their app is coming from the person that it claims to be. There is a single universal name, right? So there are, compared to something that's like more federated where it's actually based on domains, and Dan on, you know, Farcaster.social versus Dan on Farcaster.me, like that's actually two different people. In the Farcaster system, it's similar to Twitter or Instagram, is there's a universal namespace. So, you know, Dan, I'm actually DWR. DWR on Farcaster, there can only be one. And like you have a reasonable guarantee that if the app that you're using is following the Farcaster protocol, you don't have to be confused. And so any app that you switch to, assuming it's not malicious, it becomes very easy to identify that the same person is who they said they are. And so that's the kind of like melding of like we're trying to kind of create this decentralized identity space, which still needs to kind of be sorted out, and we'll see if it ends up working at scale with the user experience of Web2, which we know works at scale and that users like. And so that's about what Farcaster is like. Can you blend the best of both worlds? That's awesome. That's really cool. One question that I have is related to the social graph, right? Like the social graph, there is still a social graph that's built on top of the client. Is that still sitting on the blockchain or is that separate? Each application will have a social graph, and we can go later on into AMPs, which I think are a little bit separate from the social graph, but will be used in applications on top. Yeah, so our original hope was to put the traditional follow graph, who I follow you, you follow me, that those are all just kind of pieces of data that you could then construct in a decentralized way. Put that on the Farcaster hubs, right? So it's kind of like this permissionless data set. Any developer can spin up a hub and then have access to the global state of the network. I think where it gets a little challenging is, so if you actually think of what a Twitter follow is, it actually means two different things. So the first thing, which is actually what most people initially think is, I want to follow this content. I like show me more of this content or show me every time that this user posts. But in a network where it's actually public, like Twitter, and people can actually go through and see who you're following. And if you're not following that many people, there's actually this secondary thing that's implicit endorsement, right? So if I follow X person, and I'm only following 200 people, clearly that person is at a minimum interesting. And beyond that, it's like something that I endorse what they're saying. And obviously, that's not the actual case. You could follow plenty of people you disagree with, and in some ways that should be encouraged. But I think that the reveal preference is that people, I don't know, they have mixed feelings on who they follow. And or it actually probably, there's a number of follows that would happen on people's main account if they could make those private, right? And so what do you get? You get all these people use lists, which are private. People have alt Twitter accounts where they follow people. And so our view is, A, that action is a bundled action that could you actually separate what the, I want to see more information from this person. I want to endorse this person. And then the second thing is in a decentralized network, you have no guarantee that different applications are going to respect the decentralized follow, right? Because if there's user demand for private follows, you're going to have some applications that just do private follows. And then so at best, you're getting an altruistic social graph versus, I think one thing that we strongly believe as we're building these systems out is incentives rule everything. And so what you want to do is actually design things that end up at the protocol that have an incentive to actually naturally be decentralized. And so a cast, like a public post, has a natural incentive to be decentralized because most people who are casting, they're optimizing for distribution, right? They want as many people to see the post as possible or the people that they want to see to see it. So as a result, you using an application that does not actually publish a cast to the protocol means if your other followers are not using the same client as you, you're not going to see that. So there's a game theory in that you're only going to get users to use your client unless you're actually using the protocol. So cast is a natural area or a natural content type that will be decentralized just by virtue of the incentives. Like's the same thing, right? A private like, that's a bookmark. But I think a public like is actually meant to give some amount of interaction with the person who posted a post. So most apps are probably going to follow the public like. And then to the degree that you want to do a private like, just call it a bookmark. The last thing though, if you think about followers is then if you want to split what follow the content and endorse, we came up with this concept called amps, which you can think of an amp as a kind of recast. And for those who aren't a forecaster, recast is the equivalent of a retweet. And if you think about today on something like Twitter, you only can retweet a tweet. You cannot retweet an account. And so for us, amps are this concept of it's something you have a limited quantity of. So there's some scarcity to it. They automatically expire, which actually creates a level of freshness for them. And as a result of the mechanic, you're not actually taking a piece of content that you're amp. Amp stands for amplify. You are amplifying the account. And so what we're hoping is you actually start to get a dynamic leaderboard for the network of interest in this, right? Like an amp can mean anything, but for the most part, like when you recast something or you retweet something, you're basically saying kind of like, I want to boost this. So again, some amount of implicit endorsement. And so I think amps will be that for accounts. And then the nice thing is because they automatically expire, it's not a cumulative metric, right? It's actually something that you have to have some skin in the game proof of work where people are constantly wanting to boost your account because you're contributing interesting takes or liquidity to the social network. And so the long answer to all this is the superior version in a decentralized system of a social graph where you can't guarantee every client's going to follow it is use the primitives that you know have an incentive to be decentralized and effectively create an implicit social graph where you actually look at who you are replying to, who you are liking, and who you are amping. And so by actually taking that, you in some ways actually get something closer to maybe the original page rank model for Google, which if you think about how pages were ranked, it was, okay, some amount of semantic analysis of what's on the page, but then who was linking to you and then the recursive algorithm that was linking to those websites and giving everyone a score. And then as a result of the score, you score the actual content based on the interestingness based on how interesting the people linking to you are. And I think that that's probably the world that we're headed into with decentralized social. I could be wrong, but I think if you strongly believe incentives are the only way to guarantee that people will kind of follow through on things, then I think an implicit social graph is probably more likely and in some ways actually more effective, right? Because if I follow you and I never interact with your content versus I follow you and I reply to every one of your casts and I like every one of your tweets, that's technically each being followed once, but there's way more engagement on one than the other. Very cool. So let me play the devil's advocate, right? Why make it a sufficiently decentralized social network? Decentralized ones work great. Twitter is perfect. It has no problems whatsoever, right? These social networks have no problems whatsoever. Why make it sufficiently decentralized? And another question related to that, why not make completely decentralized, right? So why sufficiently decentralized instead of completely centralized or completely decentralized? Yeah. So maybe just start with the issues of a centralized network or a completely decentralized network. So if we start with the centralized network problems, I mean, I'm sure your audience will know that there've been a bunch of problems with centralized social media companies over the last few years. You may have varying opinions on them. There's a lot of political spin on either side of that, but I think you could get a universal consensus that they're not perfect. And so there's room for improvement. And I think the challenge with centralized social networks is they don't allow client choice because of the way that their business models are. And you could actually build a centralized social network potentially with a different business model that may have this to work, but we can put that to the side. So yeah, maybe you could go try to build a competitor to Twitter that's completely centralized. But I think that the challenge is if you don't have client choice, then inevitably you're bundling a whole bunch of things together. So you're bundling content hosting, which there's liability with content hosting, which then means content moderation gets bundled in. And it's not like they offer you different versions of content moderation. There's kind of like a single content moderation on the bus policy per social network. And then you actually don't own your distribution, right? And so if you view these, especially public broadcast networks, as this kind of tool to reach an audience, and if your business is being in the business of producing content, not having control of your audience seems kind of crazy. And especially because we have contrasting examples of both the web and email. And so it's just the fact that these kind of networks have so much attention share forces all of these people to have to use them, but they're still at the whim of these networks. And so you can be yanked from the network at any point for whatever reason. And it used to be, oh, the only people were getting banned from networks were right-wing people. But I think we've just gone through a period recently with Twitter where a bunch of left-leaning people were kicked off the networks.

# How Farcaster can take over centralized social networks ｜ Dan Romero [_kdjry8w0dA]_part2

The same people who a year ago were saying, oh, build your own Twitter, or this is the right model for content moderation, have become staunch defenders of free speech and thinking that policies saying that you can't link to Mastodon or whatever are completely ridiculous, which they are. And so getting a network like Twitter to be a credibly neutral common ground like email or the web, I think, is a moral imperative. And then I think to go over to the reason, well, why don't you just make it completely decentralized? And so there's no centralized point of failure. Well, so first of all, our belief is if you actually make the identity decentralized, and then you still have centralized operators of kind of services, then that's the kind of like happy medium. So it's not like it's centralized relative to a decentralized thing. But like a purely decentralized system, something that's completely peer to peer, the usability isn't there. So it's ideologues. It's the year of desktop Linux. It's like, oh, well, if everyone just got a little smarter and more sophisticated, then we could have a utopia. But the reveal preference is consumers don't care. They care about usability and convenience. And so you have to marry the two. You have to have the core parts of the architecture be in a way that are sovereign, censorship resistant, whatever term you want. I like to use consumer choice, like I have pure freedom to move between different applications on the email network, as well as on a network like Forecaster. Same thing with a web host, right? And then you have to have the usability and performance and convenience that people expect. Otherwise, you're never going to get the audience to show up. Thus, even if you're publishing on this decentralized thing, you're just like, who cares if there are not that many people using it? And so the goal here is an Internet scale protocol that billions of people are using. And so if we if we want to get to that Internet scale, you have to have the users. And the users are only going to come if the user experience is good. But to your point, it's like, OK, should you go build a centralized company? Right. Just like a more developer centric version of Twitter. And I would I would argue that because of examples like Twitter pulling the rug out from under the developer platform, Facebook pulling the rug out from their developer platform, some of the stuff that's happened with the app stores on mobile is, I think developers are deeply skeptical of building on other people's platforms. Basically, the only company that's actually, like, I think, maintain a really, really good standing with developers for a long time. And I'm sure I'm ignorant. Some of the history where they may be less, less good is Microsoft. Right. It's like they I think realize and there's the famous quote. I think it was like Chamath was talking about Facebook being a platform and Bill Gates was in the room and Bill Gates was like, that's not a platform. Platform is when the aggregate value of all of the companies built on top of your thing is greater than the thing. And in the case of Microsoft, that's a pretty big thing. And so I think my my push is people are sophisticated enough to know why would I go build a business that now has platform risk? Because if you want to extract more rent from me, you're going to be able to do it. And I think the mobile app stores are a great example of this is, yes, there are actually a lot of big companies that are built on top of it. But over the last five years, those those policies have been more and more extractive as a result of this kind of like duopoly that exists within the mobile ecosystem. And so all the way back is I think that the only interesting way to get serious developers to build really at scale, interesting new companies and projects is to actually prove to them that they can't have the rug pulled out from under them. Thus, the the you need to make it centralized enough that the developer trust the network exists. Right. And going all the way back to how to define it. Another way I define forecasters, it guarantees two things. If I publish something and I have an audience, then the protocol itself should have no intermediator. You know, there's no intermediate intermediary between myself and my audience like that. It just just works. Right. We can have different service providers, but the protocol itself will distribute the message on the developer side. The developer should have permissionless access to the data and APIs for forever. Right. And that's one of the reasons we're working on this thing called Forecaster Hubs is when those launch, hopefully in May, the network will for the first time from a data and an API access standpoint, onboarding will still be gated. But from a data and API access standpoint, once you're once you're into Forecaster, you can do whatever you want with the network in the same way that you could with something like theory. And so that that's the focus of building a sufficiently decentralized network. It's trying to get the usability of Web 2 with the ownership, strong access guarantees of Web 3. Interesting when you're talking about the protocol, I was just thinking about SMTP and I was thinking that I don't even know who created or which company was involved, you know, into building that. And it's something that there's so many tools built on top of it. And I imagine that for Forecaster, who who hopefully hit a point where, like, we don't even know that Merkle Manufacturing, which, you know, you guys started, create Forecaster. It becomes such a used protocol that, you know, that would be nice, you know, in 100 years from now or 200 years from now, we look back and be like, oh, yeah. It was like actually Dan Romero and Varun that created this protocol that everyone uses. Related to, you know, the protocol and the network. So you both are building a product led protocol. So if I'm mistaken, you can correct me there, but it seems that you're building some sort of Twitter like experience on top of, you know, this protocol. And you are really focusing on making sure that the growth is very deliberate instead of letting users just flood the system. Why is that? Is there a benefit? And what are the pros and cons of that approach? I'll take it in two parts. So the first product led protocol goes back to this idea that you have to make it easy, usable, convenient for end users to use something. Right. Like, if it requires them installing some command line tool or compiling, like, never going to happen. Right. And so you have to make easy to use apps in order to actually bootstrap because you're building a social network. Right. And so the atomic unit here is a post or like and getting the social liquidity requires people to actually have ways of doing that. Right. Like, if the first step is, well, we have this protocol, build the client. And then if you have a client, then convince other people to show up and then we'll have an interesting protocol. Whereas I think we flipped it on on Ted is saying, if you want to get to the Internet scale protocol. You need a bunch of apps and services, apps and services are only going to show up if they're users. Right. Like, just assume everyone's lazy. Not not a bad way. Just like you have to do the work. And so in order to actually attract developers, you need a population of daily active users, because that's actually the hard thing. That's the thing that that developers like really want. Right. Like building the technical stuff is fun, but that's that's like achievable. Getting users is actually the hard thing, like more and more than anything else. In most cases. Right. There are examples of technology companies where the tech is the hard part. But generally, the software, it's getting users right distribution. And so our point of view is the thing that will be most attractive to building on top of Forecaster is if we have bootstrapped an initial user base of highly engaged, daily active users. Right. And an analogy here is the iPhone app store. Right. Which is an extremely successful developer platform. The first year the iPhone existed, there was no apps. You couldn't build a native app. Apple built all the native apps for the iPhone. And only after that first year, after they sold five, 10 million iPhones, did they launch the app store? And then they had an immediate marketing point where they could say, hey, we have five or 10 million people walking around that, you know, your daily active user, if you have a phone, because it's on your body. And so naturally became a place where developers wanted to start tinkering. And even then it took multiple years to finally get to a place where you had the native apps that kind of discovered the magic of what makes a mobile app like Instagram or WhatsApp. And so it takes time to kind of build those ecosystems. And so from our standpoint is, OK, well, if we want to get to this long term goal, the best way to start out is build the initial version of the protocol. No, it's not necessarily going to scale and then spend most of your time building the initial app. And we quickly realized that most of the features that are table stakes. To building a new social app, regardless of if there's some new mechanic, most of them look like Twitter, right? It's like the ability to post the ability to reply, the ability to get notifications, ability to like to follow. And so I think if you just think of it like, what is an MVP social network for the most part, it's something that looks like Twitter. And, yeah, the mechanics can be slightly different or very similar. But but that's like the foundation, right? Because if you if you just basically make a client that if you just think of Twitter is like kind of like a very simple generic structure. If you make a Twitter client that is primarily focused on images as the post, you have Instagram, right? If you make a client that is every post has to be a video. And instead of stacking them up, you auto play them and you only show one at a time. You have to talk. And so if you just think of these public social networks as kind of little bit of remixes and then UI changes on how they exist, then you can actually get to a place where far castor the protocol does the heavy lifting on identity. Authenticating messages, propagating messages, storing messages. And then handling how someone is replying to another person or the interactions that are happening between them. But other than that, developers can actually build whatever experience they want on top of it. And it's just actually displaying the same data in a very different way. Right? Just imagine taking tick tock. If all the social networks are built on an open standard, tick tock or Instagram could be totally displayed in a Twitter like feed. Like in Twitter, right? It would say the person's name, assuming you had the same user name across all of them. Geo just published a video on tick tock. And then you have a link to the tick tock. Or even embedded in there and then you click it. That's how Twitter does it versus the way tick tock auto plays. And so I think that that is the strategy on the product led protocol is bootstrap enough that now there's enough people using it that other people are going to be interested in building other apps. The second part on the onboarding side of things, we have a strong belief that quality is hard to maintain regardless. And the best time to have quality is at the beginning because you have the most control. Right? And if you actually have your quality dip too low, too fast, it's going to be very hard to attract. Right? If you have a low quality social network in terms of like you just invited as many people to juice your numbers, the high quality people don't really want to be there. And if you don't have those high quality people, like, those are the people that actually bring in audiences. And so our strategy was, well, why don't we just take this a little bit more gradual? We have a ton of stuff that we need to build and just try to be consistent. Grow 5% every week, send out X number of invites, measure that, see how the retention is, talk to users, figure out like what's working, what's not. And there's a secondary component of that with consumer apps. People actually make an initial judgment the first time they use an app. And it's very hard to unwind that judgment. Right? So, if I show up to an app in the early days, because I wanted to go for viral growth and outside of something being so compelling, right? Like, it is so different and new and not easily copyable, by the way, by another existing network. I might stick around even despite issues. So, like, be real is an interesting example of this, like, be real is a new primitive, like, very simple kind of game type social network. Can be copied by the other networks. I think that they're trying to play around with it. They've had issues where you try to load because everyone loads to be real at the same time per day and their servers don't work. But clearly they've hit into they've tapped into something that's so powerful that they're continuing to grow and retain users. So, outside of coming up with some new primitive that is so good, I think that the better, like, kind of like iterative approach, if you don't have that lightning in a bottle new feature, is keep your onboarding more limited and then iteratively improve it. And then you're naturally going to find a group of users that even the rough app resonates with and the incremental improvements that happen every week or every month is enough to keep them around. And I think you can build up cohorts of those people at a certain point. You actually start to hit a sufficient conversational liquidity that the people who originally would have turned because it wasn't interesting enough now are sticking around because it's going from kind of this bar that has, like, three people in it to it's like a really lively bar. So, even if you don't know everyone here, it's like, actually kind of fun to be there. And so that's the mentality that we have. All that said, we have 8000 people in a beta. Like, if you just think of orders of magnitude, that probably works for another maybe 10000 people or 20000 people. But to get to that next order of magnitude, 100000, I think we need to change our tactics and think through it's like, okay, how do you solve for that next order of magnitude? And then 100000 to a million is going to be a different challenge. Interesting. Yeah, I mean, in my experience, Forecaster has the best community out there for tech centric people. It seems that Forecaster is the new South Park where, you know, like all the builders in 10 years ago would gather around South Park, Twitter. Apparently, the idea came out in South Park. It seems that, you know, all the cool crypto people are in Forecaster and we see a lot of applications built on top of Forecaster and also other crypto applications that people use Forecaster to distribute. And it's a great platform to distribute. So I love that. You've mentioned in another interview that, you know, there is an analogy of using if addresses and you addresses, you know, with Facebook and whatnot. Are you approaching importing users that have if addresses? Is that right? And if so, why? Yeah, so I think it's worth identifying the initial niche that you hope to kind of like build some amount of community and traction with. And for us, it was naturally the like, Varun and I had both been at Coinbase for a while. We were kind of at home within the crypto world. And I think for me personally, like, I joined Coinbase, we were like Bitcoin only and I still own Bitcoin and I think highly of Bitcoin. But I think over my time at Coinbase, the natural community that I shifted towards was more oriented towards Ethereum because I tend to be more pragmatic. And I am much more interested in forward progress. And I think where my biggest critique with Bitcoin is, I think it's okay to be conservative. I actually, I really respect the kind of intellectual foundation of like, what they're trying to achieve. But I think what's challenging is going back to my point about centralization versus decentralization. You might actually have the high ground on ideals. And in the case of Bitcoin, obviously, there's, I think, the brand advantage and just market cap and being first mover. But I think it's very dangerous from a, like, the world is, they're competing things all over the, you know, all the time. Right. And so whether you like it or not, Bitcoin and Ethereum are competing for certain things. And I think what I like about Ethereum, there are plenty of things I don't necessarily like about Ethereum, but the thing I like about Ethereum is there's a sense of forward progress and an improvement towards, like, making this computing platform that you can go build anything on top of it. I can't build the forecaster identity registry on top of Bitcoin. And then you have a whole bunch of people to kind of like, say, oh, we'll build it on L2. It's like, no, no, I don't want to build it on L2. I want the security guarantees in L1. And so you can go back and forth on whether Bitcoin versus Ethereum, but the reality is, even if you said Bitcoin is more secure, Ethereum is the clear number 2. And so in that case, like, I would take Ethereum over any L2 experimental system, just from a Lindy, like, has survived some actually pretty big things in its history. And so, look, I hope to get to a point where a forecaster is actually just like anyone interested in anything wants to use it. But if I had to pick a community to go after, the one I best understood within the crypto world is Ethereum, right? I don't actually know really much about Solana, like, and Cosmos, other things like that. And so it's like, focus on Ethereum. That's my social network was there. And the other thing I think that's important is we actually just don't do that much on chain. And so, like, if you think about the existing forecaster client experience, yes, we show NFTs in the app. But it's not necessary. Like, you could go build a client that didn't have any of that. And in some ways, you can actually abstract away the stuff that's happening on chain in a way that you just do that one action on chain when you initially register. And then you could have a completely different experience the rest of the time. So it doesn't necessarily have to have anything to do with Ethereum. And so I think that my general philosophy is build something that people are actually going to use. That's the most important thing. And then from there, you kind of earn the right to expand out over time. Very interesting. Yeah. I sit in a very weird place myself because I like all these different communities and I find myself without a tribe. I think Bitcoin has a lot of value because it's very conservative. And if you know, if you're dealing with money, I think that's very, very important. I think a lot of people care about that. At the same time, I really like Ethereum because there's so many applications built on top of it. I mean, Uniswap is a clear example. Right. But there are some also newer protocols, you know, like Solana and Avalanche and Aptos and so on. We'll see which ones turn out to be actually, you know, sustainable and good and have a clear user base and developer base.

# How Farcaster can take over centralized social networks ｜ Dan Romero [_kdjry8w0dA]_part3

Ethereum seems to actually have a strong user base, but we'll see. It's hard to say in five years, at least in my opinion. One question that I have though is, what are the, for Ethereum, what are the things that you think Ethereum is doing really well and things that Ethereum can actually improve? Yeah, we can start there. Yeah, so look, for better, for worse, gas costs. That's, it's just not good for growth, right? And when you understand what gas costs are, it's okay, we have this limited amount of resource, we're now having a free market for it. In some ways, it's quite elegant and great. But if you're in the, I'm trying to build an application that's gonna scale to millions, if not billions of people, that just like directly interacting with Ethereum is just not gonna happen because I think the real preference of consumers is they like free, right? And so I think driving down gas costs through whatever set of techniques, whether that's kind of optimizations of how the network works or using L2s and then figuring out what applications should live in L2s, assuming you can actually get good security guarantees. I know that's the priority, but I think it's very clear that it's a blocker to growth as a result of having high gas costs. And so maybe there could have been an argument, and I don't know how I feel about this because I do like the security guarantees of having a lot more decentralization within Ethereum, but maybe you say, hey, make the blocks bigger because that's a parameter change effectively. And yes, you're gonna get less decentralization because of the result that it's gonna be harder to run a full node, but maybe that's right. I haven't actually spent enough time thinking about that, but the builder in me is a little bit more oriented towards that. To be fair, that was my original opinion of what Bitcoin should have done, is the Bitcoin block should be bigger and make a bet that the computing platforms, whether it's storage or network bandwidth or processors, or everything just gets faster. And then this is not as much of an issue, but I'm also not working on any of those protocols directly. So that's just my opinion. I think what Ethereum has done really well, and this is the primary reason I'm most interested in it as someone building. Like I wanna be clear, like my previous answer on Bitcoin, it's actually less on the investment. Like, do I think like this is money versus this is money or like what should be your allocation or like, am I a Bitcoin or an Ethereum? No, I just think from a pure, like I wanna build an application that has some credible amount of decentralization and the core aspects of the architecture, in our case identity, Ethereum is the natural place to go build that. Our Forecaster identity registry contract is actually a relatively simple in the scheme of Ethereum, like smart contracts. And doing that on Ethereum means I get all of the composability and everything else happening in the ecosystem. You bring up Uniswap, right? Forecaster usernames are going to be NFTs. So out of the box, whether it's Uniswap's NFT platform or OpenSea, all of the economic infrastructure for NFTs, which people think of as, you know, like monkey JPEGs or whatever. No, no, like the domain name auction system, which if you've ever tried to buy a domain name in the DNS world, it's pretty clunky versus buying an NFT is like modern e-commerce in the scheme of things. And so all of that comes out of the box, right? And so you can have all these sophisticated, you can have auctions, you can have listed prices, you can, and then they're completely composable. So someone could take an NFT, create ERC20s on it and then actually have a Uniswap pool and then based on if you control the majority share of those ERC20s, you can actually now use this Forecaster account. The amount of permissionless innovation that can now happen at that level of our stack is, I think, extraordinary. And it starts to compound on each other, right? It's like for every new thing like Uniswap or OpenSea, in addition to all the tooling like MetaMask and all this other stuff, it just further makes it more appealing for people when they have their next interesting idea to want to go build on top of that. And I use it akin to whether it's Linux or JavaScript or whatever, where once you start to get the ball rolling in one of these kind of composable open source communities, people naturally want to build something that other people will use. And so they're going to go, you're going to write it as an NPM package or a Python package because all the machine learning people are going to use it. And so I think that that is the thing that Ethereum has done the best. And I think when my biggest critique of other blockchains trying to compete with Ethereum is it's not a checkbox. Oh, well, we have this version of a Uniswap, or we have like, it's not a matrix where if you can do all these actions, then people are going to move over to your chain. It's this intangible thing of, I have an interesting new idea. Where is the marginal developer going to go try that idea? They're going to try it where there's the most liquidity, right? It's not about the functionality. It's about the fact that a bored ape or a punk actually, and not even that, you can take something that's even cheaper, like an NFT that you'd want to play around with is actually already on Ethereum. And so that is the single best thing that Ethereum has going for it. And even if they screw up a whole bunch of other things, it's a very difficult thing to unwind. And I would just caveat that with is if someone really comes through with some huge technical innovation, then maybe people will say, hey, it's actually worth rebuilding the ecosystem because this is actually a step function change rather than something that's incremental. And I think people get really hung up on transactions per second. And that's not actually the, that's not the, that's more incremental than people think because anything that's like a lot of transactions per second, if you just add a lot more transactions per second, at some point the bandwidth of that blockchain is going to be full, right? And so I think it's like some fundamentally new architecture or whatever, but in that case, I think a lot of those next generation approaches are actually being built for Ethereum, right? You have your L2s like Optimism and Arbitum, and then you also have the ZK approaches that if some of these things that are still very science experimenty right now, they end up working out, then you get kind of the best of both worlds. You get the usability of one of these things that can then compile back down to the security of Ethereum. And maybe someone's able to achieve the same stack on top of Bitcoin, but I think going back to this idea of the developer momentum and each interesting thing that happens on Ethereum encourages the next marginal developer to work on it. I think that's the thing that Bitcoin had for a moment in time. It was very much the case, 2014 to late 2016, even, when I was at Coinbase, there was still a lot of energy around building on Bitcoin. And then I think 2017, it really shifted over to Ethereum. And you can take the negative side of that coin and say, oh, it was just a bunch of scam ICOs or whatever. But I actually think the thing that lasted, and it clearly worked because what happened, I think, with the DeFi build out over the last few years, is 2017, the energy around Ethereum and the excitement around Ethereum as a developer platform, captured enough interest that you then ended up getting a bunch of economic infrastructure that got built out. And again, you can criticize DeFi as being kind of, whether you want to say scammy or not big enough or whatever, but the reality is that Uniswap is actually an amazing application. It works, right? And through all these big crypto blowups, none of the DeFi protocols actually blew up. It was the, you know, Terra notwithstanding, because it's slightly different in the sense that the Uniswaps and the Aves and the compounds of the world performed this function, right? Or as designed. And I think that that is, I don't know. I like, I think people just want to believe what they want to believe. And so if you don't like crypto, you're just going to find every reason to come up with dumb reasons for crypto. But again, I go back to NFT for us is actually this really interesting thing because we get all this economic infrastructure for free. And I just view NFT as no different than a file format, right? It's like JPEG or PNG. And it's like, oh, what else other things can you do with a PNG? And I think people get way too religious about like these crypto things versus thinking of them as building blocks. And it's like, I always approach it from, and the thing that's gotten me most interested in crypto over the last 10 years is just like, what can I build with this? Like what new thing can I offer that wasn't possible before? And in the case of Farcaster, it's we can build a web two-like experience on the social network, but under the hood, the identity is truly sovereign. It is not controlled by any individual, any company, any organization or country. And we're not quite there yet, right? Like we're not on Ethereum mainnet. You need to decentralize the governance of the contracts. But when that happens, those Farcaster governance or those Farcaster registry contracts will run forever with the programming that they've been instantiated with. And no one can go and take your username pointer away. And I think that that is a really powerful thing because it'll encourage developers to build the next Facebook, the next TikTok, the next Instagram on top of a protocol, because they know that this institution effectively is really solid and it's gonna outlast any government or different administration or set of rules. Yeah, I agree 100% with you there. And I think I usually make an analogy in my head with like Ethereum as a blockchain with JavaScript. It was like really early on and it has such a big ecosystem and now it has been improving so much over time and it's catching up with like newer languages, but the ecosystem is so, so big. And I think Ethereum is the same. And another point that I thought it was interesting, the Uniswap, right? Like I was looking at their growth and their growth was, I think in 2.5 years, they grew as much as Coinbase grew in seven years. And I think Coinbase is one of the fastest growing companies to IPO out of YC. Like I was thinking about it and looking at their market cap, it was really, really fast. Even though inside there were ups and downs and maybe there were times of slowness because of crypto winterness, the growth is really astounding. Okay, I have one last question because we're running out of time. That's related to book recommendations. Do you have a book recommendation that shifted completely your view on something and you recommend, you're an avid reader. And so any book recommendations there? Yeah, I think the book, I would say in the last 10 years that shifted my point of view, at least at the time, the most was definitely Peter Zayan's Accidental Superpower. And I've talked a lot about Peter Zayan and tweeted about it, casted about it. But the basic premise is this is a book that was, I think came out in 2014. And so it was kind of written around 2012. And Peter Zayan is a kind of like a strategy consultant for geopolitics. And he kind of has a historical framework that he brings to the table where he basically says all of the great empires first started out by having really good internal transport within their country, usually a navigable river and good external barriers to prevent invaders from showing up. The quintessential example of this is Egypt. Egypt had a navigable river for the most part on the Nile and desert on either side. So it kind of keeps invaders out. And so you have this civilization that flourishes for a really long time. And then he kind of shifts to saying the next kind of major advantage for countries is deep water navigation. And then finally industrialization. And his point is the accidental superpower is the United States because it has the best river system in the world, the Mississippi, Missouri. It has two giant oceans as barriers protecting it. The best Navy in the world, like effectively the only real Navy in the world and industrialization in the sense that it has all the resources that ever needs for itself. And so he kind of has that as his framework and it's a very geography driven. And he goes through basically all the major countries and he kind of walks through all of their issues. And he does this in the second book as well. He also kind of predicts in this book a couple of major trends. So the first is deglobalization. So when he's writing it, we're kind of at peak globalization and everyone is assuming that this is just gonna continue forever, cheap stuff at Walmart made in China. And he's saying, hey, like the trend is actually going the other way. He says that you're gonna probably see some type of populist president in the US that is like anti-free trade, which he kind of gets the idea of Trump. And then he says the US is actually gonna be energy independent with this fracking thing. And he thinks it's gonna take longer. And then his followup book, he basically is like, I got that wrong. It ended up happening way faster. But, and I think all of this stuff is culminated with the war in Ukraine where, and now that zero interest rates are going away, we're kind of like a return to history, so to speak of like, okay, like the world is a little bit more of a tough place. Like we're not living in this like 30 year post Berlin wall, end of the Soviet Union, globalization boom. And we're now kind of back to maybe a more of a great powers game where you have the US and China and Russia and people kind of figuring things out. And I think the Ukraine war, he both nailed in predicting that Russia would invade Ukraine in one of his books. And then the other thing is that the supply chain impacts of taking a country like Russia out of the global supply chain has had some pretty big reverberations and is actually changing geopolitical moves for a bunch of different countries. And so that book I think was important to me because I think I had spent a bunch of time in college and then kind of in San Francisco. And I think I was a little bit more just consuming a lot of mainstream information. And I think that book was the beginning of me kind of being a little bit more independent thinking in terms of trying to diversify the set of sources that I'm getting, focusing on first principles or primary sources. I mean, being friends with biology and others like that, I think has accelerated that as well, but also even working in crypto because there's a concept called Gelman amnesia. I always say his name wrong, he's a famous physicist where he'd say, I'm reading the New York Times and I'm reading the science section and I'm reading something about physics. And I know every single incorrect, inaccuracy written in this article. And I'm like, wow, how does this even get published? This is just kind of crap. And then flip the page and there's some more happening in some other country. And then you just take the section that you're not an expert in as complete truth because you just don't have any way of pointing out the holes. When at the same time, this is the same publication that on the page that you know the information about is not covering stuff correctly. And so having gone through that for five years at Coinbase and crypto, I just generally the way the mainstream media covers crypto is extremely lazy. Like very, very rare to get someone to come in with the nuance or actually do the extra work to maybe get the right quote. They tend to get people who are just like incendiary on the quote side. And the law of bad headlines is just like, okay, like we're gonna write the most negative headline that you possibly have. Crypto doesn't help itself. So it's not like it's all roses and rainbows and it's unfairly covered. I think it's more, that really had me start to think. And especially actually after I left Coinbase and I took some time off and I did some travel and I spent some time outside the US and I really got to a place where, okay, I actually don't wanna have any one individual or source be the primary way that I think. I wanna be able to compile it across a bunch of different points of view. And so it really kicked off when I was off before starting to work on Forecaster is I tried to read a lot of history books and try to get a lot of diverse points of view. And look, I still read the headlines of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal every single day. I actually don't even need to read the article most of the time because at this point, I've read so many of those articles, I probably know the format of what's gonna be said or you only need to read the first two paragraphs or like, you get past the intro and then you actually find the point that they're making. But a lot of times they just communicate in the headline and then you can just read what people are saying on Twitter as the meta commentary. But the point is I read that, but then I also try to get exposed to as many different ideas on something like Twitter. And so one of the reasons I'm super interested in building something like Forecaster is A, I hope it to be global scale so that as many different viewpoints in the world that exist can actually be on this just like the internet is. But also I think that what's cool about building something that's gonna have a permissionless set of data and APIs is I actually think developers as the network and protocol continues to grow are gonna really surprise us in terms of coming up with new ways of presenting information. And like one example of this is I've always, always wanted a new site that tries to just basically show you here is the closest thing to a factual event that we can report, like the highest certainty of like something happened. And then give you the opposing views or you can dial it being like, okay, I want a slightly right of center take on this or I want a slightly left of center or I want the extreme views on the same issue. Right, and so it's just like, I don't know, but whatever the news is, like the Biden documents, I could care less about the Biden documents but based on what news source you read, it like is either a nothing burger or it's like the biggest, biggest thing ever. And what I would actually prefer to have is like a bunch of different viewpoints. And obviously I would love them to be intelligent, right? I'd love an intelligent left leaning take and I'd love an intelligent right leaning take. But I think in a world where you really have full access to the data and APIs of a network like Twitter, which is the gold forecaster, you will actually have people create things like that. And with machine learning and stuff like that, you could actually get to a place where, you could build apps that deliberately try to get you outside of the filter bubble. Whereas I think with the current instantiation of Twitter and who knows, Elon may change it. It's actually about time spent. So if you naturally have an inclination to follow right or left leaning content, you're just like the proverbial like YouTube radicalization, you are actually going to get more and more of the same type of content if you're engaging with that. And so having the freedom to create your own client that maybe doesn't have that self-referential loop or it's like, hey, it looks like you're actually getting too much of one side. Like we're gonna actually inject actively the other side. I don't know, the free market can decide if people actually wanna live in that kind of world. So long answer on Zahan, but I think it, and by the way, I don't agree with everything that he says. I think he underestimates technology a lot and he glosses over a lot of details. But I think what's great about Zahan is he presents a lot of fair or written content that pushes community

# How Farcaster can take over centralized social networks ｜ Dan Romero [_kdjry8w0dA]_part4

data that you can actually go pull from the UN or, you know, the EIA on the energy side, and you can verify yourself. And you can say, okay, yeah, that chart is actually true. And so from that regard, I think it's a really interesting book if you've never read it, because it will challenge maybe some preconceived notions on, oh, the US is declining, right? If you like, read the Ray Dalio book of like, losing US reserve currency. And I know we've talked about this a little bit. Like, I think Ziahan in major points has convinced me that the US is not going to lose its reserve currency anytime soon. And the primary reason is I don't think any other country has like a particularly great outlook. And so far, I think he's kind of right. Like, and so, you know, maybe Bitcoin or a cryptocurrency eventually replaces the global reserve currency. Like, that's an area where he was recently on Joe Rogan, and he said that that wasn't going to happen. But, so I disagree with him there. But then the question is, we're just going to argue on timing, because I don't think anyone realistically thinks that the reserve currency of the world is going to be Bitcoin next year. But 10 years, 10 years is a long time, right? So. Yeah. Yeah. Just, yeah. Sorry, I wanted to add some points and then close it out. Yeah. In the globalization point, I really think that that's happening, but I think it's going to be, instead of making cheap stuff in, you know, other countries, we're going to make cheap stuff in the countries themselves. So I think a really good example, I mean, Teslas are not necessarily cheap, but they're trying to make the cars cheaper and cheaper. And, you know, with automation and like more robots and things like that, we can actually make really cheap stuff in the US, in America, in Germany, in China. And I think that's the trend. Another thing that I was thinking about the other day is how, you know, the US and Russia took very similar stances. The US basically blocked Russia, you know, from, I think, getting back their money from treasury. And Russia basically blocked, you know, like they had a lot of, they didn't block, but they had a lot of power within Europe, especially Germany, with regards to natural gas. But both situations, they found a way around it, you know, like Russia sold it to China or other countries and Europe found natural gas from, I think, the US. So like this, the globalization, didn't like, even though countries are trying to block each other, the world is so connected and there's so many connections everywhere. That's really, really hard for one single country to have such a strong influence, that being either the US or Russia, which maybe that's wrong, but that's what I was thinking the other day. And then maybe you call it re-globalization, right? Like it's just going to reshift the way things are. And yeah, I think that that's right. And look, if you believe in free markets, like if there's a high enough price somewhere, someone is going to try to solve that, even if the oceans are a little bit more pirate-filled or infested. And, you know, some of the things that Zion says, like you kind of like roll your eyes and saying, okay, like probably not going to happen. That said, I do think it's a useful exercise. And I would give credit to the Biden administration on, A, they've been very aggressive on the trade stuff because they're viewing the kind of Taiwan situation. It's a continuation of some of the stuff that Trump was doing. And I think that the other thing, and it's full of pork, but the fact that the US is now actually investing in onshore chip manufacturing at some level of scale that beyond what we already have, I think is a very positive long-term trend. And then to your point, and I'm a little bit of an Elon stan on this part, but like, I think that the Tesla robot, which everyone loves to make fun of, whether it's Tesla or somebody else, like it's so clear to me that that is what's going to happen where all of a sudden you're going to have a massive deflationary effect because you're going to actually be able to do dangerous and dirty and jobs that basically people don't want to do. We have a structural shortage of employment in the US now. I think that is going to be a huge impact on our ability to decide how we want as a country, where we want to engage in the world and what we want to do. And I'm generally very pro-isolationist. I think we should kind of fix our own problems at home before we're worried about other people. And I think we can offer certain things to other people that want to help us, but I think we have a lot of people in our country that we need to actually focus on first and a lot of issues and infrastructure that we need to improve rather than mucking around in other people's problems. And that's actually one of the things I think the Zion book also really made me realize, and this just idea of energy independence is, I think that's actually the root of all evils of everything is if we can get to some level of super abundant energy in the US with a combination of nuclear, solar, natural gas. And if we can get to that point, I think that just like the world that we can build in our country, but also around the world is going to be really great. And so that's like, if I could redo the technical background that I have, it would be, because I have a pretty limited technical background, it would be much more in the world of atoms than software. But my goal is try to impact the world of software enough that I can then make some impact in the world of atoms later. Yeah. With that note, with that great note, thank you so much for taking the time and talking to me. I really, really appreciate it. I know how busy you are with Forcaster. It's really, really hard to build something really valuable. And I think you and Varun are in the path of doing it. Again, I really, really appreciate it. And I hope you have a great weekend. Thank you. Yeah. Great. All right. Perfect.

Today's guest is Dan Romero, co-founder of one of my favorite web free projects. And the project is named Forecaster. And if you make a quick look at it, it's you might think, OK, it's a decentralized Twitter, but it's much, much more than that. And I'm sure that in the next few months, it will be one of the most talked about projects in the whole space. So I'm happy to have you, Dan, here today. Thanks for having me. So like before we get to Forecaster, could you tell a little bit about your backstory? Because you've been in crypto for a long time. You were employee number 20 at Coinbase. So could you share a few words about this time? I moved to Silicon Valley in 2013, and then I promptly dismissed Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme and magic internet money. The backstory there is I went to college with one of the co-founders of Coinbase, Fred Urshom. And when I was moving out to San Francisco, he pitched me on joining as one of the earliest employees at Coinbase. I think they had maybe just hired Olaf, who now runs Polychain Capital. But they had a huge customer support backlog, and they were just looking for people to get their hands dirty and help them with the massive amount of growth that they had happening at the time. And I hadn't read the Bitcoin white paper, and I just completely dismissed it. Like magic internet money, why do I want to work on that? I ended up joining a SaaS company. And finally, being out in San Francisco, what I found was anytime I met a smart person who seemed to have really interesting perspectives on technology, they also had a perspective on Bitcoin and generally found it pretty intellectually interesting. And I think as a result of that, I finally got around to reading the white paper. And after, you know, it's pretty simple. I think it's eight or 10 pages. I think the language is typically pretty clear relative to, if you think about most cryptocurrency white papers today, they tend to be very math-oriented and technical. Whereas I think the Bitcoin white paper is incredibly cogent and much more approachable than most people think. I think it's worth everyone's time to just read it, even if you don't want to work in it, just to understand what kicked this whole industry and trend off. So I read that, and then it becomes this mind virus where I can't stop thinking about Bitcoin. And the thing that I was most excited about is Bitcoin as a kind of new computing primitive. So when I read it as 2013, 2014, mobile was really hitting its stride. And I think the thing that drew me to Silicon Valley originally was I wanted to build consumer products for people in a way that you could walk down the street in New York and Boston and London, and you could potentially see someone using a product that you worked on. That was exciting to me. And I think Silicon Valley traditionally has been the best place to do that. And what I saw in Bitcoin was, oh, this is how the next set of apps after mobile are going to be built. And so made the switch over to Coinbase, ended up staying at Coinbase for almost five years. The thing I was wrong on, one, people aren't building those consumer apps on Bitcoin. And there are a variety of reasons. I think Bitcoin has opted for a particular strategy around decentralization, which I actually think makes sense for Bitcoin, but makes it pretty difficult to build consumer applications on top of them. And then I think that the second thing, and my time at Coinbase is, it's still really early for cryptocurrency. And so I think we're in this kind of deployment phase where for the first, my first five years in crypto, the on-ramp and just getting people from going to fiat to crypto was the challenging thing. And I think we're probably at the order of magnitude now of like people who've bought their first cryptocurrency or have a cryptocurrency wallet, where it makes sense to start working on some of those consumer applications. And now that it's not just a Bitcoin-only world, I think that there are other blockchains and other technologies that you can actually use to go do that. And so that kind of five years later is why I kind of left Coinbase and now working on what I'm working on. You started Farcaster in 2020, as far as I remember, with Varun Srinivasan, who also worked at Coinbase. So what was Farcaster two years ago and what is it now? Like how this idea evolved? Well I reconnected with Varun in 2020. We had worked together at Coinbase and we went through a whole bunch of ideas. Varun had been a little bit more interested in DeFi stuff. And I think for me, I had an interest in kind of some of, again, these consumer applications, a whole variety of them, some of them non-crypto. And as we kind of went through the various ideas, just kind of brainstorming, like how would you approach this? I think one question that we found particularly interesting and spent a couple of weeks on was the question of why did RSS lose to Twitter? And then the kind of flip side of that is how could you make RSS competitive with Twitter in 2022? And for those on the podcast who don't know what RSS is, it's real simple syndication. It's a protocol, it's permissionless. It is actually how you're probably getting this podcast today to your podcast player. It's kind of this in the background, pushing information out. But it's really kind of stagnated since around 2010. And in that era, I think a lot of what we have now with centralized social media kind of outcompeted the ecosystem of independent clients and stuff built on top of RSS for a variety of reasons. So one discovery I think is vastly superior for kind of some of these centralized social networks, I think particularly Twitter. I think the usability and kind of not having to kind of configure multiple different services to all work together. Twitter, in some ways, is just kind of this nice vertically integrated experience where you sign up with an email or phone number, you can start following people, you have an app all from the same company. And I think that plus Google also had a product called Google Reader, which was one of the largest in the space. And they actually just killed it overnight because it wasn't making them enough money or worth their time. And so in exploring that idea, we did this kind of big, long brainstorm and thought through a bunch of different things from first principles. We said, why don't we start working on a prototype? And we were calling it RSS+, the idea being, you know, make something that's a little bit better than the existing thing that can be potentially competitive with Twitter. And two years later, with a bunch of iteration, hiring some people, having users in a beta, we now have something called Forecaster, which spiritually is related, but has evolved quite a bit since. You know, I'm obviously a very avid Forecaster user, but for people who have never tried it, like, what is it like? How does this user experience look like? Like I opened the app and what do I see? I think if I was just to pitch someone in an elevator, it would be Forecaster is like Twitter, but if you're really into crypto, that's the super simple pitch in terms of like what you would actually be using every day if I sent you the app. Fine. If you're interested in crypto, maybe that's more interesting to you. But I think when you peel it back a little bit more of how it works, which I think it's worth pointing out, most people don't care how something works. They just care about how to use it or how they experience it. I think that's completely reasonable and fine. But in terms of what we're actually trying to do, Forecaster is what we call a sufficiently decentralized social network. We can get into that in a bit, but it's a social network that isn't controlled by any one company or individual, and it offers two guarantees to users and developers. So for users, you have a direct relationship with your audience. And the analogy I always use, if you build an audience on Twitter or YouTube versus building an audience on an email newsletter, if Twitter or YouTube decide for whatever reason you can't be on their platform anymore, you lose their audience. There's no chance to get to export your followers and bring it to something else. There is no recourse. You can't sue them for it. That's the terms of service, right? Centralized platform. Contrast that to email, where if you build an email newsletter and you're using MailChimp or Substack and you decide to switch platforms or one of them doesn't want to work with you, you can export your entire mailing list, move it over, and it works seamlessly. Like your newsletter subscribers don't even know that you're using a new newsletter service unless they're technical or kind of looking at the details. And so what Farcaster is promising is if you build a following, so you have 10,000 or 100,000 followers on Farcaster, no individual client or platform can take that audience away from you. So you're free to kind of move between different pieces of software built on top of on the social network. The developer guarantee is somewhat related, and it's that developers always have access to the underlying data and APIs of the social network. And the example I'd give you here again is Twitter related. Twitter's early days, all of the mobile clients were third party. So it was independent developers playing around. There's a lot of actual interesting innovation. Pull the refresh came out of an early Twitter client. And at some point, Twitter decided to change their corporate strategy. They have every right to do that. And overnight, all of these clients kind of lost the ability to build meaningful independent businesses on top of Twitter. So it kind of went from this like very API, open API friendly company to, hey, we're going to focus on our first party client because it's potentially offering a better user experience for people and we can monetize better on ads. I don't think you can fault them for that decision, but it is pretty jarring for people who had spent hours and years building these clients to have that change overnight. With Farcaster, if you go and build anything, whether it's a kind of client application, a new service, new type of social network, the access to the API and data, that's guaranteed. But more importantly, any users you get, they belong to you. So there's no kind of third party company that can come in and say, actually, you know what, we're getting rid of sign in with Farcaster. Now these users don't belong to you anymore. Sign in with Facebook, that kind of happened as well with Zynga. And so those two premises are actually the core foundation of what we hope that as Farcaster scales, it can really earn the right of being able to call it a protocol. And what I think of as a protocol is you have a variety of independent clients, applications, businesses that are thriving, and it's not dominated by any one company or service. And I think that is better for consumers because it forces the different applications and clients to compete on user experience. And it's much harder to do rent extraction, if not impossible. And I'll give you one last analogy, because this is what I grew up with crypto, crypto exchanges. Crypto exchanges are built on top of these permissionless cryptocurrency blockchains, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the core service that they're offering, the conversion of fiat to cryptocurrency. It requires work and now it's regulated, so you have to have enough money and resources to do it. But if you just look at the history of crypto exchanges, there have been a bunch that have come and gone. And you know, Coinbase has been there through most of it. But Coinbase has had new competitors happen even after Coinbase has been at scale. Contrast that to most of the other stuff in Web2, where once you kind of get these proprietary network effects, you know, the classic example here is the Airbnb fees, right? Everyone complains about how like they list, you know, like $500 a night, but it's actually $1,000 a night if you take everything in it. Well, there's no way to do a competing client on Airbnb, because Airbnb has worked hard to build that proprietary liquidity for their marketplace. But it's built in a Web2 way where it's not a protocol. Whereas you can imagine at some point in the future, if someone is clever enough to figure it out, if rental stock for housing was more of a protocol, you'd have a bunch of competing clients trying to offer the best user experience, right? And so that is the vision of where we want to take Farcaster. But like I said, where it is today is it feels very much like Twitter. You open it up and it's a bunch of people talking about cryptocurrency. And so I'm happy to talk about how I think about going from where we are today to where we want to head to. But that's basically Farcaster. Yeah, I think Dan that you're very humble when it comes to this short definition that it's just like a Twitter for people in crypto, because yeah, I've checked many web-free social products before. There's been this, you know, like, like, very old history, like Steemit, and there was like Bitcloud, all these crazy innovations happening there. Now there's Lance. But Farcaster is really special because you can really feel that you focus on user experience. And I think your onboarding process is very, very interesting. So if you could tell like, in a few words, how does it look like? So I created an account. And what happens next? Because I think it's really, really worth discussing. Our onboarding is interesting in that it violates some conventions from Web 2.0. So kind of the make your sign up as easy as possible. That's how you you get to make a product great. And it violates some conventions from Web 3.0, which I can talk about in a second. So from a Web 2.0 standpoint, it was interesting when we first launched the beta last year, we had an insanely simple process. I think it was two steps. It was you'd sign up, you'd pick a username. And then we say backup this kind of like passphrase, and then you're good. Like you're ready to go. No email required, nothing. And I think that the initial feedback from people at least stated preference was, wow, this is this is an amazing onboarding. But the reveal preferences, a lot of people churned. So what we actually ended up doing over time is we added a bunch of steps. And part of this is because the app is currently invite only. And you can relatively get an invite pretty easily. You know, you DM me on Twitter or someone refers you and most of the time I'm sending you an invite if you're not spam bot, basically, that's what happens. But the interesting thing is when you have an invite only app, there's high intent for people to want to sign up. So you can actually add more friction to the onboarding process, which again, kind of goes against this Web 2 conventional wisdom. But what you get out of that is if you can get people to finish a longer onboarding, you end up having the initial first experience be way higher, both for the user signing up, but more importantly, other people in the network. And I think one one thing it's worth thinking about from first principles is so Facebook is kind of considered the like they were so good at their onboarding and, you know, shaving off every single click tap like it really worked for a network, especially a network that you had to find other people, you know, and they had all these like magic tricks that they could do because of the contact importers and all that other kind of stuff. But for something like Twitter, it's a public network, right? And you're actually trying to find people that you might find interesting. And so given that we're focused on Web 3 and crypto natives today, we've taken this approach where you fill out all this information. So your profile looks pretty good. We give you this big button when you start. It's hey, here, here are 50 people that, you know, we do a little bit algorithmically, but it's also some curation right now that we think represent the best of what Farcaster is. And part of it is I use the network a lot. So I have a general sense of what those accounts are and it changes. But that experience is great for the initial user because they sign up and they kind of already feel like, wow, I'm ready to go. But then the other thing that they get is they get a bunch of people to follow them, right? Because if you sign up and you just have a username, no profile photo, no bio, someone might not want to sign up for that. Whereas if you've taken the time to kind of fill everything out and then we just have a most recent signup list because we're not growing that fast, you tactically you end up getting, you know, 20, 30 people to follow you within the first hour, which I think on most networks, you don't really have many new people following you unless you really have a big audience. And if people who do follow you, they tend to be like almost like automated accounts or something. And it's like, you don't trust that. And so I think it actually has this really nice experience that creates the social like connective tissue pretty fast for people, which helps with the potential. The web three component, though, that I think is different is we actually don't allow you to bring your own wallet, which I think people have told me that that's crazy. You don't understand crypto despite having been in crypto since 2014, that we basically have made a decision that when you sign up for Forecaster, we don't want to require you to have a wallet. We want you to generate a new wallet that the application that you're using, whether it's on desktop or mobile, now has full access to the private key. And if you if you've ever used a kind of web three app and you want to actually do multiple actions from your kind of core Ethereum wallet, you have this really clunky flow where you keep getting kicked out to third party application. Right. So imagine using Twitter and you like a post and then you get kicked out to MetaMask and you have to like actually click. And it's really technical because what you're actually signing is this like weird JSON blob, which doesn't make any sense to a normal user. Whereas by taking the pain of saying, no, we don't even allow you to import a wallet. You have to get a new wallet, back this up, which people lose that. And so we've had to think through some improvements on the UX for that. Once you're in, everything can just magically happen for you. And then it's really focused on our opinion on how the user experience should work. So we've kind of broken out of the mental prison of saying, oh, well, everyone should just use this existing wallet. And part of it is we can do that because we don't have to do stuff on chain. Right. So if you're playing around with money, you can't do it in a kind of like new wallet because you can't just like add money to that person's account. It's like playing poker with fake money. It's like the consumer psychology completely changes. But based on the forecaster architecture, where we only really do one thing on chain and what we care about is actually that public and private key in the background. We're actually able to do this, deal with the pain up front, you know, front load as much of that pain. And then once you're in, it's like all you can eat. And I think that was an informed experience also by Coinbase, where Coinbase started out with really simple onboarding. And what you ended up having is a lot of these customers thought they had a Coinbase account. And then when they wanted to go buy Bitcoin or ETH, they would get hit with this KYC, know your customer, like, you know, show your passport and all this, which is this really user hostile action. And people would get mad at us. They'd be like, wait a second, I wanted to buy Bitcoin and now I have to go through this flow. Whereas we shifted at some point, I think it was like 2017, 2018, where we just did everything up front. And then once you were in, you never got hit for another request for the most part. And that's a vastly better user experience. And so to kind of summarize, I think onboarding, a lot of people kind of cargo cult some of the web to like make it as simple as possible. You want to go as viral as possible, contact importer, all that kind of stuff. Whereas considering the shape of the network and actually what your specific go to market should actually be much more informative for how you want to do onboarding. Yeah, I would add also that there's like a bot that recasts, which is basically like retweeting the posts by new users for like a week or something like that. So you get some exposure, even though like you might have 10 followers, you might get exposure to hundreds of followers. So if you post good content, you can get many followers quickly. Which is cool because the newcaster bot is actually built by someone in the community. So it was a permissionless idea. And when the network was smaller, basically, I would go to the recent tab most days, I would click through to see if people had done a post, then I would reply, just my standard one is GM and welcome. And it's like kind of like someone showing up to your house and you're greeting them, right? And when Katsuya launched newcaster bot, I was like, oh, wow, we should have built this ourselves. But what's so neat and going back to the whole point of farcaster is it's at a place where the developer, if they have an interesting idea, it's not post on farcaster and convince the devs to do something. It's you just doing it.

# How they built web3 social media ｜ Dan Romero, Co-Founder @ Farcaster ｜ Web3 Talks #32 [LkpDHdn9GJY]_part2

yourself and he didn't even have to ask me for permission to build this this bot it just kind of was able to happen and it's incredibly popular right and you actually get a lot of new users who follow it as a way to sample oh are these new people coming in how's their content without necessarily even having to follow them it kind of something that we didn't come up with on our own and ended up being a really good feature the interesting thing that you said about adding friction is that on the like higher level you go against the common wisdom that if you are a VC funded startup you need to grow fast because you know if you add friction and people need to DM you on Twitter like you know someone on Forrecaster calculated that if you get like 50 people on board it every day so you'll get 2 million in like 20 years or something like that so this is very counterintuitive to go for slow growth so I'm wondering like why have you made this choice I think part of its informed by just seeing how some of the social products of the last few years have played out and I think to step back again like look at a little bit of history as well as just first principles where are we in 2022 so with history what's the most successful social network Facebook Facebook was invite only for two plus years right you had to have at first it was based on the school you were at and then eventually it was a dot edu email address but for to think of Facebook the most successful network has actually been gated and for the time that it was the way it was described as the college social network and it was so much smaller in comparison to my space which was the general purpose social network I think people under appreciate that in terms of why did Facebook end up winning and I think if you build an engaged user base that is high quality and here it's a rough proxy right like college students being high quality versus just general any signup that becomes a high status thing where people then actually want to join that network and I think the other thing is if you build a product especially in crypto and you can kind of say this even with Twitter there are a lot of bot accounts and kind of people just if they can programmatically create something they're just gonna do a bunch of it because it potentially is useful for them for whatever nefarious purpose they want to do that for and I think you run into an issue and I'm still trying to formulate this but it's kind of this concept of you have a total number of daily active users on any social product and especially a public one where you can kind of see the other profiles it's like one thing I don't know if you know about be real or some of these other networks where it's a little tighter where you might have a group of 10 friends and then it's fine you can almost think of it as like a like a messaging app is actually very similar to this and that if you have a few conversations you'll actually be a daily active user regardless of whether there are you know a thousand people using that app or a hundred million people using that app but if you think about the kind of ghost town problem of if the daily active users to the total number of signups feels like hey I'm one of the thousand people who's using this app every day but there are a hundred thousand people who signed up just doesn't feel cool it feels like those ninety nine thousand people figured out like this isn't isn't useful anymore and so I think that from that standpoint what we're actually trying to build is this kind of ratio of daily active users to total number of signups and if we for whatever period add a number of new signups that churn especially on the kind of like one month or three month mark which is I think a lot farther out you know you have a terminal product right like if you can't retain people over the long term at a consistent rate you're just it's just the time function of yeah you can add a whole bunch of people go viral you know get really high vanity metric numbers of total number of signups but if over time you're just leaking those users out because fundamentally their problems and either the product or the quality of the network and all that then basically you're you're dead and so I think Varun and I don't want to just have a social network that we can say oh look we got up to a million or ten million people to sign up and then it kind of fizzles out I'd rather be small for a while and be building a product that people actually want to use every day and that's another thing I think a lot of people love talking about signups which is a cumulative metric very few people like talking about DAU because daily active users and DAU is really hard because to be a daily active user if you're kind of taking that as an average that's like a vote of confidence every single day that the app is providing you some amount of value whereas you can trick someone to open up an app I don't know once a month with a push notification or an email or something like that and so by just kind of working on the hard thing it forces our focus whether it's in the product or the protocol to actually be delivering something of value to users and if it's not happening then that's on us to figure it out and so I think where we want to be is consistent growth so 5% weekly growth is our target which actually relatively straightforward to do right now but if you know about compounding 5% weekly over the course of two or three years starts to get much harder and I think that that philosophy also allows us especially given our team is small to grow into any bit of growth right so if now all of a sudden the network feels lower quality for whatever reason or we're running into some I don't know harassment issues or whatever the issue might be we have the breathing room to actually solve that from a product and then potentially even on a protocol level whereas if you're just on kind of this runaway exponential growth train it's like this compounding problem that only gets worse and in some ways I actually saw this at Coinbase right where we had done a lot of work from 2014 to 2016 to build systems that for the previous kind of boom which was in the 2013-2014 era and then you had this exponential growth that happened in 2017 and just everything every time we thought we had fixed the system it would it would like grow again to a new peak and it was just this really challenging situation where you had these terrible customer experiences because it's very very difficult to build as a team in an exponential way like people tend to build more I think linearly and so what you ended up having is like in the 2018-2019 era Coinbase did a whole bunch of scaling and then in 2021 like it just broke again because you hit new heights and so I think some of that is informed the way we think about is like can we work on building this really high quality engaged user base consistently growing but also make sure that the product and protocol is kind of growing reasonably alongside it and I think it'll only get harder but for now especially given the team is small I think it's for us I think at this point it works like you have this really magical moments there like for example you know Chris Dixon who is not that active on Twitter because you know he he has like a pretty official Twitter account there like you can see him just like hanging out and commenting some people who have like 20 followers sometimes what does he think and you have these stories where you know you just you have NFT feed on on Fardcaster and you can just accidentally discover some cool NFTs because you see that your friends minted something you can also you know have better engagement than on Twitter like this JMJ like he had this post where you know having I don't know like he has like 10k followers on Twitter or even more and he gets like five comments maybe and he posts something on Fardcaster where he has like 200 followers and he get like 50 comments or something like that so this is really powerful and this network density like you can really you can really feel it in the air and somehow there's also like very interesting choice that you made and I'd like to ask you about it because there's no quote tweets which is a perfect engagement farming mechanism for Twitter like product manager who invented this I guess he has a act as big as Jeff Bezos right now but like you know obviously it's not good for the quality of interactions it's great for likes it great for sharing disconsent but I'm not sure it's very good for the vibes on the app so I'm wondering like what was your rationale behind it and you know do you plan to implement it at some point or what's your take let me address a couple of things so first I think on the just be intellectually honest so Chris investor in our company Merkle Manufacturer which is building Farkaster so part of that is he's using the product because he's an investor that said I think if you were to talk to Chris or someone with a similar sized audience on Twitter I think that there are a bunch of things that happen on Twitter today that make it kind of unusable especially for a person with a big audience in crypto so one you have all these spam bots right so you you're Vitalik or CZ or Elon or any of these people and that you post something and it's just this infinite number of just like people giving away crypto that they're scams with like Elon or Vitalik it just is a really bad experience and I think that you know if you have a huge audience it's like do you really want to put something out and then just right next to your profound insight is just like a bunch of spam I actually think if Elon buys Twitter he'll solve that so you know that's maybe just a momentary thing but I think this is a separate thing of and this goes back to what I described Farkaster is today it's it's a community of people who are curious about crypto and web3 we put an emphasis early on of trying to find people who are kind of developers entrepreneurs people building things I'd say on average the community is more optimistic and earnest and to your point about quote tweets which I actually think ties nicely one thing that we're making a conscious decision on at least in our client which is the kind of initial client for Farkaster but but has an influence on how the network is growing right we're onboarding people into the network and the conversations the issue with a quote tweet which by the way was not invented by Twitter it was invented by users in third-party clients they used to put QT and like a good company they saw this and then actually implemented in a way that is a a well executed feature with some potential maybe intended consequences but I would call unintended consequences is basically quote tweets when used correctly like are actually really useful because it kind of adds some additional commentary but can also rebroadcast to the audience whereas when used in what I would say incorrectly or kind of like maliciously they're basically just used for dunks right and in the simple example I always say is I'm having a conversation with you at a party in kind of like a semi-public someone can come over and listen and it would be the equivalent of me walking up or someone else walking up to that conversation and saying hey everyone look at this idiot over here what he's saying and I'm gonna take this one thing out of context and and nothing like and just broadcast it with commentary to my team which gets farming and likes and all that kind of stuff so I actually think it's a relatively especially if you have a big audience and maybe you have more polarizing opinions or just unconventional opinions it's naturally gonna attract haters and so I think with with forecaster what we've made the explicit decision is what we want to actually encourage our conversations and so you can actually accomplish the same thing as a quote tweet today so the way to do it maybe it's not intuitive but if you recast our version of a retweet the original and then you reply anyone who's following you will see that and then your reply so you're still getting that like kind of post and the context but it comes in a different way of you actually now as a user if you click through it you're gonna see all the rest of the context so I think that like one example the reality is it's a little like trying to kind of keep your finger in a dam as it's starting to break is like people actually want quote tweets and threads is another good example very popular in Twitter we tend to kind of I don't know discourage in terms of even in the UI not making it easy to add threads because I personally don't like threads we could talk about it I prefer something like a screenshot essay or a blog post but the idea that we have for at least for our client is if users are trying to still do something can we actually rethink the feature in a way that optimizes for the behavior that we want on the network and in our case we are really trying to create engaging conversations where people I think of a successful interaction on farcaster is Alice posts Bob responds Alice responds and that to me is a sign of right because if Alice posts and a bot responds Alice is not going to respond to that or Alice posts and Charlie responds but Charlie is like saying you know F you Alice won't respond to that but but anything that you're basically getting a BA and admit potentially even deeper is a sign of like there's something happening even if it be is disagreeing with a it's more civil right and you know obviously you can get in a fight but I think that's like what we want to nudge it towards rather than I think some of the what I would call mature Twitter dynamics of 2022 where it's really about find something that's on team a and broadcast it to your team in a way with commentary to show how witty and cynical and smart you are and here's the thing as far castor gross people are gonna build all their clients and if that is actually what people want this like dunk fest of kind of broadcast you know the hot takes to your team that client will out compete like it'll beat our client people will actually use it that will be the reveal preference but I suspect that if you actually have this opinionated point of view and you say this is the behavior that we want to reward on the network like anything that's actually gonna get any type of algorithmic distribution on our client is gonna be biased towards that I suspect you will have a different vibe on the network in the same way that I don't think Twitter and LinkedIn are the exact same thing or Facebook and LinkedIn or you know Instagram and Twitter they have different norms I think that is a thing I'm thinking a lot about and it's like how can you actually in the product choices as well as the protocol choices instill a set of norms that make far caster different than Twitter and you know hopefully a year from now when I say well what is far castor it feels more like its own thing versus saying it's like Twitter but for people who are interested in web 3 incredible just a short break to remind you that if you like this podcast please don't hesitate to subscribe and give it a five-star review on Spotify Apple podcasts or whatever platform you use thanks a lot yeah I think also you know you lead with example like you are the most active community manager I've seen in a long time because you're super active on forecast and trying to you know just spread good vibes and good standards and let's get to the developer point of view for a second because you mentioned clients and people might be obviously aware of clients when it comes to email like you can have like Gmail or like superhuman or like Yahoo mail or whatever but it's counterintuitive when it comes to social networks because they are closed basically so what kind of clients could you have like what would be the difference between experience between client a and client B like what could you change between these options so I think in clients in three different ways so the first is what actually is being built on Forecaster today and they're they're somewhat primitive I'm excited for all of them but most of them are kind of a they index all of the data on Forecaster and then they present a view right so it might be search engine search caster instacaster is take all of the posts that have an image and kind of display it in a way that looks like Instagram another good example is there's one called any caster where you can type in any username and because the data is publicly available you can generate the feed so you can see the world through someone else's eyes right like a feature I've kind of always think Twitter had it for a hot second and then got rid of it for whatever reason but all of this is just any developer has any idea they can kind of go do because the data is all accessible one of the limitations of the initial version of Forecaster we call that Forecaster v1 which we're on still today is it's very difficult to build a client that does read and write all right so right being that I can actually use the client to post information back into the Forecaster protocol which will show up in any other clients right the analogy here being like imagine if you had an email client where you couldn't respond to people but all you could do is read the emails that you got right so not as useful so we've spent a lot of work over the last six months trying to get Forecaster the protocol the underlying thing that kind of makes everything work to a place where read write is easy enough for a motivated developer to go build and so I suspect once we're kind of done with this migration hopefully by the end of the year we are gonna start to see the first competing clients to the one we've built our company Merkel manufacturing you'll actually have it kind of so the analogy here would be like gmail versus hotmail or another good example of this in browsers right it's like Chrome or Safari it's like you're using a piece of software that kind of does basically the same thing as what the other one does but with some aesthetic differences and then maybe some kind of like features here or there the third class of clients and the one I'm like most excited about in the long term is people starting to depart from like kind of just the like functionality that already exists today and then fundamentally come up with new social primitives and new types of functionality so an example from web 2 is snapchat created this concept of stories which then Instagram copied very well and kind of you know you think of stories now is very much an Instagram phenomenon but that's the kind of stuff where that type of new social primitive enables a new type of social behavior online and that I think is the key to actually having forecaster succeed in the long run is that if that if it becomes the expert the place where people experiment with new social primitives then I think it it has a shot at winning as a protocol because the marginal developer who like wants to build a new social experience is going to be hacking on top of the forecaster protocol not on phone books or whatever web two things so a good example that I'm excited about with forecaster you have a strong guarantee that every user is represented by a public and private key happens to be an Ethereum address and that's important because you get all these really nice properties of public and private keys they kind of are to use the term composable which people refer to stuff in DeFi but I actually think from a cryptography standpoint you can do a lot with them and kind of layering and and zero knowledge proofs are this kind of area of academic research that is kind of being implemented in the first ways in a lot of ways in cryptocurrency but I think that by having a an expanding social graph of active users who are represented by public and private keys developers can permissionally start to build experiences that leverage zero knowledge proofs to do new types of speech and the example I like to give is the US Constitution was ratified partially because of a group of three of the kind of founding fathers Alexander Hamilton John Jay and James Madison had a pseudonym called Publius in a New York newspaper where they wrote a series of you know dozens of essays about why the Constitution was important and should be approved specifically to try to convince the people of New York to ratify it and so you could imagine that type of primitive now existing in a way that no company or individual could actually ever prove someone said one thing but you could say okay these three top-tier I don't know scientists celebrities venture capitalists developer pick a group of people politicians can actually all post to a group account but none of the other people actually know who that person would be and I think if you start to get into that realm of like just primitives that now exist where developers can permissions to experiment you you may find yourself in a situation where you're gonna have a bunch of new forms of speech that are uniquely enabled by by the set of primitives on the network and so that's what I'm most excited about with clients is moving from kind of read the data which is still important and useful right to kind of like have competing functionality to on a mentally new functionality that's where we need to get to but I think if you just kind of think about it like if you don't even have any users

# How they built web3 social media ｜ Dan Romero, Co-Founder @ Farcaster ｜ Web3 Talks #32 [LkpDHdn9GJY]_part3

No one's even going to build the read-only experiences. We launched the beta last year. We didn't have a single third-party developer work on the protocol for almost six months, like in terms of just using the data because there wasn't enough data. It was mostly me posting, you know, you go on Farcaster, it was like 80% of the posts were from me. And I think, whereas in the last three months, we've had a whole bunch of people permissionlessly develop even with only, you know, 3000 people in the beta, because the amount of data is increasing at an exponential rate. It's actually going faster than the growth rate of the users. And as a result, like, even with a small group of people, because again, there's a focus a little bit on quality, people find it interesting to play around with this. There's no API key required. And so they started building things. And so I think as the network grows in terms of total number of users, the content is going to grow even faster. And you're going to start to get the read-write clients because the addressable market will be big enough. And that cycle, I think, hopefully, like, creates a bit of a flywheel. An analogy I always like to use is the iPhone. So the iPhone started out, no third-party apps. Apple for the first year was the only app developer to build a native app. They actually built the YouTube and Google Maps. Like, you know, they got the data obviously from Google, but they were the developer. Then the App Store came out a year later. And the initial apps were a lot of early adopters, people who had owned the iPhone. It's kind of a flashlight app, some rudimentary games, like to-do lists, all that kind of stuff. And it took three or four years before you started to get the true native mobile things that we take for granted today. Instagram, I think, or WhatsApp being the best example of this, right? Like, the original iPhone was still sending things via SMS. Whereas once you had a data connection, you could say, wait a second, I don't need to pay like beyond printer ink levels of expense to send data. You know, I can just do this basically for free and over like way faster and more reliable. And especially in the developing world where it was like SMS was insanely expensive. And it's like if I use WhatsApp on Wi-Fi, it was free. But those didn't happen right away. It took some time to understand what new primitives were enabled. Benedict Evans has a really good frame on this is what sensors the phone kind of uniquely started to enable actually drove a lot of some of these primitives. Like the fact that you were walking around with a device that had GPS, like a high-end camera. And like those things take time for developers to digest, as well as the iteration of the phone, right? Like the camera that started out on the iPhone versus wherever we are now, I just say is a big difference. But I think that's how we think about it. So it's like clients are going to start on a pretty basic level today. But it's important because people are kind of figuring out like what can you do, and then work their way over time to more sophisticated things and fundamentally new experiences is where we want to go. What I love the most about it is that if you wanted to make a social app, as a developer, you say, okay, Facebook is broken, Twitter is broken. Let's make an app. You cannot just make a feature. You need to get this damned people there. And this is the hardest part. But what do you do? You say to the developer, hey, here are the people and you can build your social app using these people. Like you can just use the social graph. If your app is good enough, they will use it. If it's not, they won't. But you don't need to spend like five years building the social graph, going around college campuses and asking people to sign up. So this is like, for me, it's a breakthrough because I dreamt about social app when I was, you know, in college when Facebook went big. And so, but like, their network effects were so strong that like, unless you were there like, I don't know, like TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, like a few social apps from like thousands, or maybe tens of thousands apps that people try to build, basically like because of that, because you don't have an access to people as a developer. So this is really beautiful thing. I think that's a great insight in that developers who build protocols think that the brilliance and the technical specification and the protocol itself is the thing that will attract other developers to build on it and might work for an L1 cryptocurrency blockchain. Maybe it works in DeFi. I think, you know, probably not actually as much, but maybe more in DeFi because you're actually volume weighted, not user weighted. But with social, the thing that people care about is addressable daily active users, not signups. It's like people who are actually using this every day that if they see a new app, they can tap in and use. And I think to go back to the phone analogy, what makes mobile development so powerful is when you buy an iPhone or Android, you are a daily active user, but you're a daily active user that literally has the device attached to your body most of the time with a buzz. And so it's just this like crazy primitive from a addressable number of users standpoint that it makes it so lucrative for developers to take shots on goal in terms of trying to build an app that people find useful to put on their home screen. And so I think that that is the thing that if you're trying to build a protocol that like fundamentally is rooted in how many active users are using it, the only thing that matters is actually presenting developers with a group of quality engaged active users. And that in of itself is the most important thing. There has to be some amount of technical, right? Like you can't have something that doesn't scale because then it's not usable and the users will go away. But if you can assume for a base level of technical sophistication, all of the upside is driven on on active users. And in my mind, users don't use protocols, they use apps, apps use protocols. And so if you can't build a good enough app at the beginning, that is high enough quality to get users, why would anyone else build that high quality thing on your protocol? I just think it's lazy thinking. Yeah, totally agree. So like, let's say I'm a builder, and I want to build something on Forecaster. So how does it work technically? Like what do I need to know? How do I approach this kind of task? Worth delineating what's on chain versus off chain. And it's interesting, when I first started, I kind of defined Forecaster as this crypto protocol. And I think it's actually kind of confusing for people, because as soon as you do that, they think everything's going to be on chain. When the reality is, what we're building is a social protocol. And it happens to have a blockchain component, which is on Ethereum, it's on testnet today, it'll be on mainnet next year. And the only thing that's on chain is the mapping of kind of think of as like the user identity, which is kind of some combination of an identity number, and a username, which is optional, and an Ethereum address, which is a public key. And that is it. Like, you can actually just keep that primitive on chain. And it becomes the source of truth for when we say, you know, who's DWR, who's Mac, or who's Elon, you can actually all go to the blockchain and say, this hasn't been tampered with any individual or company outside of the individual who owns the private key for that Ethereum address. And what is useful about that, and actually, I get a lot of people who say, oh, well, you could do Farcaster without a blockchain. And what I push on is here are the constraints. I think I believe in universal namespaces, I actually think it's like a vastly superior user experience, right? Like, there's a reason people put at blank on like, you know, you go on TV, and it's like, they tell you the Twitter handle, it's like, it's like a very easy way for someone to find another individual, superior to domains, superior to phone numbers. It's like very human readable, kind of like very, it just like works. And so universal namespace that isn't controlled by any one company or individual, and I would actually argue that anything that's rooted in DNS is ultimately controlled by the US government. And if you've ever seen this website has been seized, that is the US government's ability through the Department of Commerce to actually just go right into DNS and like pull a domain and take something over. And I think that people don't appreciate that because most people don't run into that issue on a regular basis. And so yeah, from a user experience standpoint, you don't care. But if you're actually trying to build this credibly neutral network, that makes that really strong guarantee, those two strong guarantees that I mentioned as users control who their audience like that direct relationship and the developers always have unintermediated access to the data and APIs, you need a system that just will, it doesn't listen to anyone, it just runs the code that has been written. And that is the core primitive that's on chain. The second part of Farcaster, which is the vast majority of all the content and the average developer experience is we call them Farcaster hubs. They're still in development right now, because we changed kind of the architecture from v1 to v2. But you can kind of think of it as like BitTorrent in terms of this like swarm where it just all the data gets kind of handled for you and an Ethereum node, which for a developer, if you think about an Ethereum node, it's kind of have a standard set of APIs, JSON RPC APIs, that allow you to kind of like query different things like okay, this address or you know, whatever. And those are the two kind of core parts of the network. Everything in the hub is off chain. And the way the authentication works is that signature for any piece of content has to map to that public key that's on chain. And that private key is the Ethereum private key. And in doing so what you get is a nice property is you can't spoof content on the hub, right? There is no like, oh, I'm pretending to be Elon and I've tricked the hub, because the hub respects by default, the kind of like provenance of the namespace that exists on the chain. And so with those two elements, I think you get the best of both worlds, you get the sovereignty and the non-tamperability of the core primitive of the protocol with the user experience and speed and you don't have to pay gas and all this other kind of stuff of web2. And there will be scaling challenges for sure with hubs like we already know kind of like where it breaks in the next few years if the network continues to grow. But all the more reason that we're trying to be slow on growth. So it's like make sure all this stuff works and then also be worried about scaling and having some adversarial thinking around like, okay, where are the areas and pain points on hubs? Like, you know, who's going to try to, you know, what level of decentralization do you need probably on the order of about 100 full hubs running? Do you allow people to run their own hubs that kind of like running your own website, you can always have your content guaranteed. So I think that there's a bunch of stuff to still solve there, but I think in general, the developer experience for most people building an app on Farcaster is they just need a hub so they can download that off GitHub, run it on their own infrastructure. I would imagine a company like Alchemy or Inferior or Coinbase will just run Farcaster hubs as a service. You can sign up, use that, right, just like Ethereum nodes. And as a result of that, you have all the data on the network and it's queryable and you can kind of build and never have to worry about like, oh, what happens if my API key is removed? So I think that's the core aspect of the developer experience. We are in a weird state right now where because we have this V1 architecture, and actually because of the Ethereum merge, we had to kind of move a little earlier. So we're in this like hybrid where it's like the data is the core on-chain primitive is decentralized, but the data that exists in the beta so far is like not in a hub. And so hopefully in the next three, four weeks, that's done. Like you can spin up a hub, replicate the data and you're good to go. Yeah, it sounds really approachable when it comes to billing. And I also know that you have like a telegram group for builders that you, you know, you connect them, you answer the questions and so on. So that's an interesting one. So what I found is like a lot of communities is kind of default to Discord and they're like this proliferation of channels. It's now you're in a UI that like, I think is like very noisy in terms of all these other things going on. It's hard to manage. Like it's just like a full-time job. And I think the other thing is open access to channels. It saves you time as the like core team, but the challenge is then you have all these other people show up. So other accounts that are not developers. So as the size of that group grows, you might be less likely. You're like, oh man, there are 900 people on this channel. Do I really want to ask this basic question? Whereas our channel has grown a lot slower. So I think it encourages people to talk more. And then the other thing, and you know, I have plenty of friends who are VCs. When VCs show up, especially like kind of like VC analysts in a developer chat, then any developer who posts knows that they're going to get like kind of pinged by someone. Hey, look, so you were working on something on FarCaster. You want to have a call? And that's just like distracting. It's like, no, no, no. I'm actually here because I'm like trying to build something. And so we've tried it and it's actually worked pretty well. It's like there's a single channel. If you're a developer, you ping me. I don't, the VCs on the network aren't pinging me because I'm going to be like, are you a developer? Like it doesn't seem like it. And so I think it's created like a very nice community of, you know, it's now about 200 people where I think people feel a lot more comfortable sharing and being a little chatty, which I think is actually useful because you can always mute the channel. Okay. So like, what's your vision? Like, you know, two, three years for FarCaster, how it's going to look like if everything goes well? Yeah. So let's start with like kind of like the next six months and then work our way up. I think the next six months, the goal is to get FarCaster v2 shipped. So that's soon. And then on mainnet. And I think getting FarCaster running on Ethereum mainnet and proving out some of these hypotheses. So one, it's going to cost some gas to register. And then if you want a username, which is optional, it'll be about $10 a year. And so that's a hypothesis we have. We feel pretty good about it, but let's see if the market actually agrees with us. So getting it out to a place where we know that the protocol has its own revenue mechanism for funding protocol development. Right. So if you buy a username, it's actually you're renting a username from the smart contract, not from a company. And that money goes into a treasury for that smart contract. And you figure out how to do the protocol development, incentivizing hubs, all that other kind of stuff. That is a sustainable model for the protocol, which I think another thing that I think people don't appreciate because it gets a little muddled sometimes is Web3 crypto, if designed right and you can actually find something people are willing to pay for, you can fundamentally change the way open source development is done. Because rather than kind of having to do the Wikipedia, beg for donations, like, hey, everyone uses this free resource, but please donate. It's just no, if you're serious about forecaster, you're going to probably want a forecaster username and rather than paying that to a company, you just pay it to a smart contract in Ethereum. And I think that there are really nice ways you can abstract that and you can take a credit card over here and actually translate that into crypto and pay the smart contract over here, kind of like a domain registrar. But I think that's something that we want to prove out. I think the second thing on the protocol side is today we have one main client, our client, and I don't think that that qualifies for protocol yet in the sense that if, for example, we didn't want an individual user to use our client, let's say they were kind of really being a jerk. And like we just said, like, hey, this is actually hurting the vibe of the community. If we had to kick them off our client, theoretically, they're not kicked off the network because they have that core primitive, they can go build their own client, but practically they are. It's like, well, why am I going to build their own client? So I think the other main thing is we need to get to at least another client that has reasonable UX. And now you have what I think starts to get interesting is you have what I call exit with interoperability is that if I get kicked off this client, I can go to this client and maybe this client's open source. So it's actually, or like directly connects to a hub. So you actually have no other person that you have to really deal with. Now you have a network where you have competition, but more importantly, you satisfy that like, hey, this has actually reached a level that the sufficient decentralization while theoretical is actually now working in a kind of like practical manner. Yeah. Like apart from the funny name for the client, it should be called Outcaster. But you know, like the thing that I wanted to interrupt with is that, you know, whenever someone doesn't like Twitter or Facebook, they say, yeah, build your own social app and here, and obviously they don't because it's hard, but here you can just switch clients. If you don't like this client, you can switch the client, which is start in the future when that client exists. Right. Like intellectual honesty is important. So I think that the other thing I would say is, so all through that, we want to continue to grow because I think if you, you know, keep the network at 3000 people or 10,000 people or whatever, like it's kind of a science experiment and it's like, oh man, it's so great. Like, do you have access to Forecaster? Whereas if you really want this to be an internet scale protocol that is permissionless at some point, not invite only and anyone in the world with a good idea or whatever wants to be able to go use it, you need to actually force yourself to handle the problems as that happens. But I think going back to this kind of slower deliberate growth, we want to grow on our own terms because we're a small team and we have a lot of stuff that we're trying to do. I just gave you two big things that we need to go do. And so not being dictated by some ideology of, oh, well, because it's invite only right now, it's not decentralized. Yeah, I'm agreeing with you. But I'm giving a vision on where we want to head and we're putting a lot of work in on the protocol and thinking and trying to be transparent and communicate. And if you don't like that, you don't have to use it. Fine. But I think what's resonated with a group of people is, huh, it seems pragmatic and actually the product is kind of fun today. And why not be along for this ride? And maybe at some point, like, I don't plan to do this, but let's just take a hypothetical. We don't make the right decision and you get upset. What's interesting is you could potentially just go fork the network and say, hey, get rid of those guys like they actually aren't the right stewards. And whether that's I think an analogy is like Linux. But like in some ways you could even say like Ethereum, like a lot of those people were Bitcoiners. Right. And so at a certain point, people just said, hey, I'm going to take some of these principles, right. They started proof of work and all that kind of stuff. And it's like, we're going to go apply this with a new set of parameters. And it's happened in history all the time. Ethereum's being like a really, really good example of this, especially Christianity, if you just look at all the denominations. But the thing is, is you're free to do it. But I think that if we make the right set of choices and continue to communicate and be open and just say, hey, we're optimizing for the protocol and our actions actually prove it. I think that there are going to be a reasonable number of people in the world who understand the pragmatic tradeoffs and realize that pragmatism is probably the way to actually get to scale and the end goal of getting to scale that is sufficiently decentralized in a way that you kind of have a competing set of clients, exit with interoperability, all the things that we're hoping to get to, they buy into the vision. Yeah, that's a beautiful wrap up. Where people can learn about Farcaster, how can they get involved? Farcaster.xyz. There's the GitHub. That's read the protocol spec, understand how it works. It's somewhat approachable for even a non-developer. So that's a good place. And then if you want to access an invite to the network, if you just DM me on Twitter, so it's DWR, and you just say that you listen to the podcast, I'll send you an invite. Okay, perfect. Perfect. Thanks a lot, Dan. It was a pleasure. It was very, like, even though like I knew Farcaster, I'm a user and I thought a lot about it, it was still very mind bending to me. So thanks a lot for that. Thanks for having me. So this is almost the end. But if you liked this episode and don't want to miss the next ones, feel free to subscribe. If you liked it a lot, I'd be personally grateful if you could give us a five star review on Spotify, Apple podcasts, or whatever platform you use. Thanks to these ratings, more people can learn about web-free talks. And it's really important to me. That's all for today. Thanks for listening and see you next time.

# POD OF JAKE ｜ #117  - DAN ROMERO [Nug2zLP8GpI]_part1

Thank you, Dan, for coming on and joining me on the podcast today. It's great to finally get to speak and I've been having a lot of fun on the platform that you've co-founded or the protocol rather, Farcaster, which you can call a sufficiently decentralized social network. I think it's actually two months to the day that I've been on. It's just been a blast. It's a really great community and I know it's still super early for the ambitious mission that you guys are going to build. So I appreciate you taking the time. And I think for those who don't know you, the best place to start would just be to talk about your story and start as early as you're willing to start and talk about some of the decisions you made along the way. Well, thanks for having me and I'm glad you're enjoying Farcaster. If we want to go back to the beginning, I grew up in Massachusetts. I'm the oldest of four boys. I first kind of fell in love with the internet probably around the time we had AOL, so dial-up connection. And I remember having to ask my parents' permission to be able to go to the computer room, to go on the internet because it would block the phone line and it was limited in the amount of time I got to spend on it. And then in kind of around 2000, I think we got our first broadband connection. And I think that that was kind of the unlock for me in that all you could eat internet and Google had just come out. And so kind of this access to the world's information, I've always been a big fan of the book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the idea of kind of having a computer in your pocket that could access kind of all known information was pretty cool. So obviously when the iPhone came out, that was pretty inspiring. But I think I can remember one thing that I tried to do was I didn't think the internet was fast enough. And so I spent a lot of time on forums on how to potentially hack your cable modem, as well as changing the Windows registry values, which would on the margin improve things. I think some of that was placebo, but it was actually my first kind of diving into the internals of the thing that that got me inspired to just kind of think about how systems work more broadly and especially computers. Self-taught programmer in kind of middle school, high school. It's funny, I never kind of took it super seriously. I don't really have any engineers in my family. And so I didn't kind of think that that was a career that was, I don't know, as appealing or open to me. And so I thought it was more of an interest. And so when we went to college, I ended up majoring in English because I thought I was going to go to law school. And fortunately for me, I did an internship between my sophomore and junior year where I worked at the attorney general's office in Providence, Rhode Island in the narcotics and organized crime unit, which was a fascinating experience. And I got to see how the criminal justice system worked up close, but I quickly realized I had no interest in being a lawyer. And that kind of led me to my junior year of college where I did a little bit of soul searching and ended up kind of doubling down on just what I was interested in, which was technology. And I applied to a remote internship for TechCrunch, the technology news blog, which I think is hard to appreciate for people who are a little younger, how big TechCrunch was at the time. So this is 2009. And effectively the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, tech was kind of this oddity out in Silicon Valley. You know, if you were talking about tech, it was like Microsoft, not these startups. And Michael Arrington had just kind of taken a personal interest of covering companies that he was either considering investing in, had invested in. He was having parties out of his backyard in his house in Atherton. And TechCrunch kind of became this shelling point for technology coverage. I think the YouTube acquisition was announced there. And so it's something I had been reading throughout college. And so I worked on a remote internship. I ended up getting an internship for the summer. So I moved to Palo Alto and I spent a summer in Silicon Valley and I was totally enamored and realized that I definitely wanted to be working in Silicon Valley full time, but I didn't necessarily want to be writing about it. I kind of wanted to be in the arena. And so when I went back my senior year, I applied to consulting jobs because a friend had mentioned that, well, if you have an English degree, but you work in management consulting, at least people will take you a little more seriously as a business person or an entry level business person. So I ended up working at Bain and I did three years of consulting in Boston and then moved to Silicon Valley in 2013 without a job. So I thought I was going to start a company. I had this idea for effectively what was like a data analysis tool based on some of the experiences I had working in management consulting, doing big data analysis for companies. And that really didn't get off the ground. So I interviewed at a bunch of places, got rejected from Airbnb and Dropbox for their like biz ops roles. And then I ended up joining two technical founders working on something called Envoy, which is the visitor sign in system that you, pre-COVID at least, was pretty popular with people when they visit offices in Silicon Valley. It's the iPad that sits out in front. And I joined as kind of a first hire that did pretty much everything. So I did customer service, I did analytics, I did sales. And so all of the kind of roles that were not engineering and design. And I worked at Envoy for almost a year. And in that time, and maybe to just back up, I know this is a little bit of a rambling story, but you wanted the full thing. When I first moved to Silicon Valley, Fred Ersom, one of the co-founders of Coinbase. This is the perfect version. Sorry to interrupt, but keep going. Okay, great. So when I first moved to Silicon Valley, Fred Ersom, one of the two co-founders of Coinbase, someone I'd gone to college with, when I told him I was moving to Silicon Valley, he said, hey, we're actually trying to hire Coinbase. Like we have this huge customer support backlog. We just raised the Series A from Union Square and Ribbit. Do you want to come and work at Coinbase? And I remember kind of thinking, I don't want to work for a Ponzi scheme, like Bitcoin, magic internet money, not my cup of tea. And what was interesting is as soon as I moved to Silicon Valley and actually started meeting other people building things, engineers, it was like every smart person I ran across had an opinion about Bitcoin or wanted to talk about Bitcoin. This is 2013. And I think the thing that really kind of made me take a second look was Coinbase had raised the Series A in March of 2013. And in December of 2013, they raised the Series B from Interest and Horowitz. And we can talk about this later. I've been a big reader of blogs forever and RSS and Fred Wilson and Chris Dixon were two people I had always read their blog and big fans of their writing. And so for these two people who I respected in kind of the Web 2 world, by investing in Coinbase and doing it in the same year, I kind of took a second look at Bitcoin. And I actually sat down and read the white paper a couple of times and then it started to click for me. And then it became an obsession that I could not stop thinking about what you could build with Bitcoin and this idea of a new computing primitive for the kind of stack. So if you think of TCP IP and then you add HTTP on top of that, and then you have browsers and then you got broadband, kind of mobile in my mind. And it was a naive opinion at the time, but it got me interested nonetheless, is that I thought people would be using Bitcoin alongside all these other technologies to actually bank new apps and experiences. And so I applied and ended up getting a job at Coinbase in spring of 2014. And so that was a shift for me from kind of SaaS to a 20 person company. And my first role was on the business development side of things. And I was trying to sign up merchants to accept Bitcoin as a payment method. And in retrospect, that was like poorly thought out from a first principle standpoint. Bitcoin is slow, it's expensive, you have a taxable gain or loss every time you do a transaction. And from a merchant's, it might make sense in the sense that, yeah, you don't have credit card fraud, but from the fact that most consumers don't have it compared to a credit card or debit card means the merchant actually doesn't care. And so that was kind of this false promise of an application for Bitcoin in 2014. But I learned some useful things in doing that. And then actually just because I was on the business development team, later that year, I ended up working on the European expansion for the core business, which is buying and selling Bitcoin with fiat. And so in the US, we had a bank partner, but in Europe, we needed a bank partner that would help us process euros. And so I spent a good chunk of 2014 on the road internationally, meeting with banks all over and we ended up finding a bank in Estonia that was able to process all of our European payments. And it's kind of like the way to think about it, like finding a bank in Rhode Island. Yes, it's the smallest state in the country, but a bank in Rhode Island still has access to the ACH system or the Fedwire system. Similarly, Estonia is a super small country. I think it's like 1.3 million people, but full access to the European payment networks. So that ended up being a big break for me. And so from there, I became kind of the head of international at Coinbase. And while doing that, we actually ended up having some issues with our US banking partner, which prior to me taking that over, it was just kind of Fred and Brian managing it. So I ended up finding the new banking partners in the US, which put me in a position where kind of I was overseeing the core operational relationship for the company. If you think about a company like Coinbase, the businesses take fiat and convert it into at the time, just Bitcoin. But if that doesn't work, then there is no business. And so it kind of set me up for a promotion that I got later to this kind of VP of operations role where going into 2017, and Fred was leaving the company to start Paradigm at that point, I was reporting it to Brian and I was leading all the operational functions of the company for the most part. So in addition to the kind of like core payment relationships, BizDev reported me, BizOps, finance, recruiting, customer support. So there's a bunch of different functions that kind of loosely fall under the thing of responsibility of the VP of ops. But it ended up being crazy timing because, and for those who don't know, 2017 was an incredible year in terms of just total growth in crypto. It makes the actual 2020, 2021 bull market, which in aggregate dollar numbers is bigger, but just on a relative basis, the amount that crypto grew in 2017 was crazy. And I think one data point is I think our revenue in 2016 was somewhere on the order of $10 million. And what ended up happening in 2017 is we finished the year with about a billion dollars in revenue, of which I think like 350 million happened in the month of December. So it was kind of the most crazy work year for me in my entire career in that I had a whole bunch of public failures. The customer support problem was really bad. We just couldn't keep up with hiring, so recruiting is reporting into me. So basically every function that was reporting into me kind of broke and I was learning on the job and doing my best effort. But I think at some point in that year, Brian and I sat down and kind of made the call that we should layer me and hire a COO who had done it before. And I think that ended up being a good decision for a couple of reasons. One, it ended up benefiting the company in that we ended up hiring real executives. Emily Troy, who's now the COO there, was hired during that period. So that was a good decision. It was a good decision for me because I actually think I built more trust with both Brian and the board in the sense that I was willing to kind of put the company first rather than maybe my ego and trying to kind of maintain this, oh, well, I'm the VP of ops, I don't want to get layered. And I think in doing so kind of gave me a lot more freedom within the company in terms of what I wanted to do next, which in kind of after things cooled off in 2018, I took over the consumer business. And so I was the first general manager of what you'd call Coinbase.com in the mobile lab. So that was cool in the sense that I got to focus in, instead of focusing on the broad aspect of the business, focus in on still the most meaningful portion of revenue, but think a little bit more in product terms and work more closely with a team of engineers, designers, and product managers on that part of the business. And then I did that for another year and a half and got to a point where I finally knew it was time to leave. Great. Well, I appreciate you sharing the story. And it's very, very interesting. I've read a lot of what you've written and listened to you on a couple other podcasts and haven't heard like 90% of that. So especially the Coinbase chapter, I usually, I sort of get lucky. I don't ask much of a advanced question to start, but somehow asking for people's early story just ends up being a really interesting answer, I think. And not one that you can often hear as a listener and someone who's been following you on Twitter or something like that. And the early part is always sort of interesting, but even the Coinbase part, obviously very recent, I didn't really know your journey there. And it was really interesting to hear about. I think one thing that is particularly interesting is that you mentioned, you know, you went in and at first sort of the opportunity came up and you didn't really pay much attention and then got to appreciating Bitcoin and, you know, saw that people you admired for their blogs for a long time were investing and seemed to be a lot of, you know, progress and quick momentum there. And so, you know, took a second look and ended up joining. But your first responsibility there, like you said, was sort of working on like with merchants on payments and basically a use case that was anticipated to be a big one from the beginning for Bitcoin that never really panned out or at least hasn't really panned out yet. And going from that sort of, you know, your primary responsibility sort of being something that was almost dead in the water, like there's nothing you personally could have done to have made that use case a success to ultimately running operations to the point where it was just, you know, beyond anything you could even control. I'm curious how you navigated being in that position where like you're new at a company, you're relatively young and you're tasked with this job that just no matter what you do, it's not going anywhere to ultimately sort of diversifying your responsibilities or pivoting them to get responsibilities that gave you the opportunity to prove yourself enough to ultimately sort of be running all of the operations. And then eventually in 2017, when things just got probably too insane for almost anyone to handle, you know, I think it's really interesting that you sort of had that very candid conversation with Brian and everything. But I'm curious, like how did you navigate your way up within Coinbase over time? I think it's two things. So the first is, especially people younger in their career, if they're ending up working at a startup, the amount of effort that you can put into the job and get benefit back from is substantially more than I think most people can appreciate. So opposite example, if you were to work at Google and you're young and you put a ton of effort into your job, the amount that you can actually progress within Google is very much dictated by the corporate hierarchy, which is very driven by tenure. And if someone hasn't done something egregious, probably isn't getting fired anytime soon. So the only time you can potentially move up in the organization on average is if someone leaves. And I think that within a startup, even if the growth isn't happening quite yet, and for a while at Coinbase, there wasn't a ton of growth, the strategic shifts that happen in a small company in search of that growth can offer those types of opportunities. And I think a good example is if you put the effort in on the finding Bitcoin merchants, even if you didn't end up finding a bunch of Bitcoin merchants that turned into a bunch of revenue, how you go about doing that and the level of enthusiasm that you bring to that job, assuming some level of competence, sets you up for the opportunity that comes up to say, hey, we need to go find a bank in Europe. You seem competent enough. You don't really have much experience there, but we don't really have the ability to go hire someone who's a specialist at this point. And so I think that that effort that you put in, even if it's not going to pan out in the existing thing that you're working on, ends up creating the opportunity within the startup that you can actually attach yourself to that ends up working. And look, you have to get some luck involved in that. And then I think that navigating how the organization grows, my advice to anyone working at a startup, especially a high growth startup, is the goal is actually to be at a startup with high growth. And by definition, if you really work at a startup with exponential growth, your ability to scale with that business, especially if you're less experienced, is probably not realistic with maybe the exception of a founder. And I think we're in an era of very founder-friendly boards and VCs because of someone like Mark Zuckerberg where in a traditional era or prior era, people would hire a professional CEO. Look at the Google founders, right? Eric Schmidt. And I think Mark in staying as the kind of founder and CEO of Facebook inspired a whole generation of founders to stay in that role, which means even more so that in order to take an inexperienced founder and scale them, you need to actually put experienced executives around that founder. Because I think having that perspective and realizing that, yes, you might be an early employee and have contributed meaningful amounts to the business. If you're not willing to put your ego aside, then what ends up happening is you end up getting kind of either managed out or you're frustrated and you're mad. Whereas you can flip the situation and realize, well, that's just the reality of the situation. And if I actually approach this as, okay, this is ultimately what's best for the company, which by the way, benefits your equity, you're going to leave an impression, I think, both on the founder who's just trying to kind of figure all this stuff out, but also the board. I think people underrate their visibility at an early stage startup into a board and having a group of board members who are invested in other companies or potentially if you want to be an entrepreneur later, could be backing you, right? Chris was on the board of Quindays and Andrews and Horowitz and-

and Chris led the round in Merkle Manufacturing, my company for Forcaster. And that's a relationship that if you think in a long-term way, rather than kind of like the short-term optimization of, okay, my current title, or what's my current job, I think it shifts it to being a much more, okay, this is actually my entry into the big game of startups or big game of tech. And now I'm known as someone who's competent and willing to be a good team player. I think people underrate that. And there's actually a lot of animosity around that in some ways. And I think the right strategies, you should just be thinking in decade-long time horizons relative to your career and thinking, okay, if I do what's right by the company and what benefits the equity value, which you obviously should benefit from, that seems like the optimal strategy from my point of view. Yeah, I think that sounds great just to sort of summarize. I think work extremely hard, put the team first and take a long-term view. And all of those things, I think, any of them individually might be not pretty reasonable to do, but the combination of the three, I think is pretty difficult. And just naturally, people are selfish, not in like a bad way, but people just sort of wanna improve their situations. And short-term, everyone sort of incentivized to think short-term. It's difficult to think long-term and working hard is working hard. It's hard. So combining all of those things is difficult, but it certainly sounds like that's sort of the strategy that you took and it seemed to certainly pay off. Thus far, I think the first point that you mentioned, I thought it was interesting and resonated in particular with me about people generally underestimating how much you can get out in exchange for work put in at a startup basically versus Google or I think for, you might agree in management consulting at Bain where you started your career. For me, I started in banking and that was actually a reason I sort of cited with a lot of people was that, as for leaving was that I felt like I could do a seven out of 10 job or a nine out of 10 job and it really didn't matter. The deal as like an analyst or whatever, the deal was gonna happen at a given price and my ability to impact that was pretty low and I didn't feel like the extra effort was really producing anything and that's not like a situation I wanna be in cause it just incentivizes like low effort basically and it's not a habit I wanted to create. And so I think it's very nice to be in a situation where you do feel that the incremental effort is worthwhile even if it's not immediately obvious, you can at least sort of have faith that it is and sort of another parallel between our stories I think is that you left that first job at Bain without knowing what was next exactly and I did the same thing from banking and now years later when you realized it was time to move on from Coinbase, I think you did the same thing. You didn't know that you were gonna go and start Farcaster. You left and sort of took a leap. Can you talk a little bit about like both of those times? I don't know if you sort of connect them in your head but I think there is something about leaving a situation whether it's school or dropping out of school or quitting a job without a next one lined up that gives you the confidence in retrospect to go and do it again. Can you talk about like either one or both of those instances having the conviction to leave without knowing what's next and I'm sure people were talking to you like, what are you doing, man? Like, why are you quitting? You don't even know what you're doing. Yeah, they were a little different in that I was leaving a very structured, prestigious job in consulting with a track towards going to something like a Harvard Business School and moving to Silicon Valley to live in a, you know, a three bedroom apartment with roommates I didn't really know. I was living in a closet. I think a lot of people were pretty surprised by that and I think that the thing I was optimizing for is I wanted to be in startups and I think part of that was I wanted to be taking risk and I'm not sure exactly what had contributed to that framework. I think, you know, reading things from Paul Graham or Peter Thiel or Mark Andreessen probably, but I think at the simplest level, you know, evaluating something like, okay, I could have gone and worked in private equity from consulting and the expected value of a career in private equity probably, you know, X millions of dollars. Whereas with startups, especially if you just kind of view them as, you know, shots on goal or whatever term you wanna use, you could go through several startups in two or three year chunks and if you end up getting one right over a 10 or 15 year period, you can have a pretty material outcome and it doesn't even need to be a coinbase sized outcome, right? And that was really contributing to the second time I left. In the case of leaving Coinbase, I had a sense that, you know, I think that valuation of the company was about 8 billion at the time. So from an economic outcome, it was going to be fantastic, really, really good. And I think I was thinking in the lines of, okay, I don't really have much more to prove at Coinbase. You know, we've been there for five years and it got started to get into a situation where the ability for me to move up in the org by virtue of us hiring more senior people was pretty limited, right? I could have spent another three or four more years and maybe got promoted. But I think in terms of thinking about the opportunity cost of my time and working on things that are challenging, I felt like, okay, maybe this is actually the right time to go and actually try to start a company, which I hadn't done before. And so I took some time off leaving Coinbase and intentionally, I remember telling my wife this, I left on May 1st in 2019. And I told her that I want to be completely off, not think about a single company I want to start until one year later. And I got, I mean, we did a bunch of travel, but I got sufficiently bored. And I think COVID obviously contributed a little bit to that in the second half of that year. But I think that was the right recipe for me to A, follow a lot of intellectual interests down rabbit holes that had frankly nothing to do with technology. I read a lot of esoteric history, which is just like an area of interest of mine. And it felt like my brain got a chance to completely detox from just whatever kind of experience I'd had for the previous five years. And when I started to approach, okay, like how do I want to think about what I want to work on next? I was starting from really a clean slate and I did a bunch of time in terms of evaluating everything else that was going on in tech. And I naturally found myself drawn back to crypto because I felt like it was really the only frontier. Everything else felt like it was like a big company. So like AI is a good example and stable diffusion right now feels the most exciting thing that has happened in AI from my perspective, because it's actually not by like a super well-funded startup and feels more like a movement. Whereas if you kind of looked at a lot of the stuff that was happening in AI was Google or OpenAI or Facebook. And so kind of, I hadn't worked in any of those companies. I didn't have networks of people who worked in those companies. And so the ability for me to kind of go and get smart in that area just seemed impractical. Whereas crypto, crypto is the closest thing to what it felt like watching Silicon Valley from afar, at least in 2008, 2009, 2010, through the lens of something like TechCrunch, where you kind of had these fringe apps that looked silly, the Instagrams of the world that, oh, you're gonna take a photo of your breakfast that compound over 10 years, they get to be really big. And I think what's exciting about crypto, at least my headspace when I was reconsidering, like, should I do another stint in crypto with what I'm starting is, I think we're finally getting to the point where the infrastructure is actually there, right? So one of the mistakes I made in choosing Coinbase in 2014 is I thought that the infrastructure was basically there and it was time to build apps. And it turns out, no, we probably needed another five years at least to get to a place where you can start building the foundational apps in the ecosystem that aren't just strictly money, right? And so I think that was another input, but I don't think I would have been able to figure that out had I not given myself a year of just kind of decompression and some space, frankly, to then come back with a fresh set of eyes and say, oh, I'm actually really excited about working on this idea and there's a crypto element to it and kind of tying everything together in a way that if I was, again, at Coinbase and trying to leave to start a company, I actually don't think I would have been thinking as big. And that's another thing I think that space can provide you is the ability to kind of, I don't know, maybe think bigger. You know, I don't think of myself as anywhere close to an Elon in terms of just like drive, frankly, like I think he's willing to sacrifice a lot more than I am, but in terms of looking at how he approached SpaceX, and this is just, you know, through his biography and looking at kind of this multi-decade long journey, and he knew that that was the case upfront and being willing to work on that as well as something like Tesla, I think is inspirational in that if you do have a little bit of economic security, and in my case, the Coinbase outcome, again, I was thinking that it was gonna be smaller than it was and it ended up being bigger, great, but it didn't change the idea that I felt like I could actually take a longer term point of view on what I wanted to work on versus if Coinbase hadn't worked out, I probably would have ended up working on, I don't know, something that was maybe a higher likelihood of a couple hundred million dollar exit if I was trying to like kind of optimize for like a very specific concrete business problem rather than what I am working on, which is let's build a protocol for building social networks and how do you bootstrap a social network when you don't actually have a fundamentally new social primitive? Yeah, I'm a huge advocate, having done it a couple of times myself, for just giving yourself some time and space to remove yourself from whatever it is that you're doing, whether it's, you know, banking or consulting or working at Coinbase or whatever it might be, and I think it's certainly not the typical path most people like to sort of have the next lily pad lined up before they jump off the current one, but there's something that's maybe a little bit harder to describe, but I think you did a good job of describing to, you know, taking that time and I feel like you do have to sort of set a minimum, you know, you said, you know, a year I don't wanna start anything or join any company or start any company or basically commit myself to anything besides traveling and reading and just sort of relaxing and decompressing a little bit. And it's sort of hard to do for people who are, you know, wanna wake up and get to work on things, but there's a lot of value to it, I think. So, you know, you mentioned obviously, Forecaster was the thing that took you out of that time and was the area where you wanted to commit the next 10 to 15 plus years of your life, which I think sort of how you have to approach any hugely ambitious startup. You know, I mean, you look at Brian with Coinbase or Elon, you mentioned, these things don't just become successful overnight, especially if you're the founder, you sort of have to see it all through if you want it to have any chance of success. What was it about, you know, social media, social networking that in particular drew your attention and can you sort of describe Forecaster briefly for those who haven't yet, you know, gone on the app or seen anything about it? Consuming information is the original hook for me on the internet. I mentioned that before. And I've met a user of RSS and RSS feed readers for, I don't know, as long as I can remember. And Twitter came out, you know, 2006, 2007. I had signed up in college. I built an early Twitter API app and I've been a power user on Twitter for 15 plus years. It was kind of a joke at Coinbase that if something happened on Twitter, I would know about it. And so it was just natural areas of interest for me. I like to think of myself as someone who deeply understands the Twitter product, despite never having worked there or frankly at any other social media company, just the user of the products, not an employee. And I think that that space has always been interesting to me and has been rattling around my brain in terms of how would you actually make Twitter a protocol? And that ultimately was the question that when I reconnected with Varun, who my co-founder, I worked with at Coinbase, he and I both kind of thought that the question of how do you make RSS competitive with Twitter was an intellectually interesting one. And we evaluated a bunch of other ideas that were not related to this, but we ended up coming back to this idea and started to build a prototype to kind of say, okay, well, you know, RSS is this kind of boring, old protocol, doesn't have much state. I don't, for those on the line, it's just kind of this idea that anyone can kind of publish an RSS feed, from their blog or website, and they can change it any way they want. And there's kind of no way to authenticate, okay, well, this was like this before, or if I like a blog post, how do you even represent that? Where something like Twitter, all that's solved, because it's all just Twitter database. And I think we kind of went through, from a first principle standpoint, what are the things that kind of led to RSS's demise, right? Because there was a period where RSS and Twitter, when Twitter was much smaller, were roughly comparable. And there were actually a lot of RSS power users. Google had a product called Google Reader, which was free. And then over the first five years of Twitter's kind of existence, basically killed RSS. It was a superior product, especially on mobile. And Google ended up killing Google Reader, which kind of nuked the RSS space for a while. The interesting thing is that RSS is actually how all podcasts are distributed. So person listening to this podcast right now, whatever client you use, whether that's Spotify or Apple Podcasts, in the background, RSS is the way that the podcast audio file gets distributed to all the different services that ultimately you listen to. So it's actually still used, and probably if you just look at the growth of podcasts, it's probably used more than it ever has been. But there is no company, there is no core team, frankly. It was a one-person effort. And so it kind of hasn't really, it's stagnated. And so it's in some ways like email in that it's really not progressed in terms of the technology. And so I think where we approached Farcaster, and ultimately the RSS Plus was the name of what we called, what turned into Farcaster, is we are going to build a company that actually builds the initial client on top of the protocol. And our belief is that if you wanna build a protocol, something as big as email, which is SMTP, or the web, which is HTTP, you actually need to build that first great user experience. And I think two analogs here, HTML, HTTP, Tim Berners-Lee, that was this academic protocol that was invented. But the thing that actually made the web start to take off exponentially was the launch of Netscape, which Mark Andreessen was one of the co-founders. And it was taking an academic project, Mosaic, the browser, and turning it into a commercial product, Netscape, which moved at a much faster rate of innovation and really pulled the web forward in terms of a timeline. And so a good example of this is Netscape wanted to enable the ability for people to have e-commerce experiences. So they invented SSL, which is the way you do kind of secure shopping online. And when you have a commercial imperative, you can actually still build these open standards and open protocols, but because you're actually trying to make a superior user experience for your users' customers, I think that is the optimal way to actually build out protocols in terms of you dog food your own protocol, but then you're improving your client, your app as fast as possible. And then the other example I would use is the iPhone, which the original iPhone was only first-party apps. So Apple built every single initial app on the original iPhone, including a YouTube app and a Google Maps app. So they got the data from Google, but Apple was the one that built the app. And the thinking there was you get an installed base, and I think in the first year, they sold somewhere between five and 10 million iPhones. And then a year later, you can launch the app store because you've done the hard work of getting that initial set of five to 10 million people to actually be a daily active user of the phone. The phone is literally carried around on your physical person. So it's an amazing developer platform when they open it up a year later, because now it's, hey, we've built this operating system, device that we can handle all these different devices and sizes and all this other kind of stuff. And you as a developer can just ship once, and it can go out to all these other potential users. And so I think that those two things have inspired us in terms of how we've approached building what we're building. And I guess I should define what Farcaster is. I think you mentioned at the beginning, but Farcaster is a sufficiently decentralized social network, and it has two properties that are different than centralized social networks. The first is as a user, you have a direct relationship with your audience. And the way to think about that is if you make a living by publishing tweets or YouTube videos, or pick your favorite type of media, if for whatever reason, an app in Farcaster doesn't want to allow you to use it as a platform, you as the user have the right to actually switch to a different app, but maintain access to your audience. And if you think about something like YouTube or Twitter, if you've built up an audience on either of those social networks, and either of those social networks chooses to not have you be able to use it anymore, there's no way to export those followers, right? And so one of the reasons people always want to try to get an email address from subscribers is that it's a fallback to be able to contact them. The second thing that Farcaster enables is because it's a protocol, all of the data and APIs are open, which enables a developer to say, if you want to build an application on top of the Farcaster protocol, you have a direct relationship with not only the underlying core data and APIs, but any user that chooses to use your app, that's a direct relationship between you as a developer and the user. Cons that too, Twitter, which Twitter in the early days, actually a lot of Twitter's early usage came through third-party Twitter clients. And there was a while where Twitter didn't even have a native mobile app. All of the early Twitter mobile apps were kind of built by independent developers. And at a certain point, Twitter said, hey, we are actually gonna force most users to go use the core Twitter app, which can display ads better for us and all of these other...

for potential reasons. And overnight, a whole bunch of businesses were kind of, had the rug pulled out from under them. Another example of this is Facebook. Facebook built a big app developer platform right before they made the huge pivot to mobile. And Zynga built a really meaningful business on top of Facebook. Facebook changed the rules. That has serious impact on Zynga. And I think the guarantee with Farcaster is because you're actually moving those core APIs and the data to a protocol, it ultimately becomes a user's decision whether or not they want to use an app. And I think that that's a really strong and powerful guarantee that you can offer a developer for when they're thinking about, okay, should I actually invest time to go build a really high quality app and experience? And if they know that someone else could at some point just turn the APIs off, then they're, I think, on the margin, less likely to do that. Whereas in the case of a kind of protocol-based app development, you can make that investment knowing that no one is going to be able to kick you off the protocol. And ultimately, it's on you to develop the relationship with users. Yeah, I mean, it's certainly more attractive to go and either build a client or even just as a user, interact with a platform with certainty that what you do there will persist in the long haul, independent of one organization or one person making a decision. Trump being like an obvious example on Twitter, invested a ton of time there and arguably, probably contributed materially to helping him win the presidency and ultimately got kicked from that and other platforms and tried to build his own and whatnot. That's a little bit of a separate story, but that was one of the biggest moments for me that I realized why it's important that social media and social networks are decentralized because that's a lot of power that Jack had or Twitter as an organization had. And it's just very debatable. There's still obviously people who would have preferred to continue to see Trump's tweets and maybe they don't go sign up for his new platform or whatever. I think there's a lot of hype around decentralization these days and especially in the crypto world and people forget what the actual point is. And I think when it comes to social media, a large part of the point is decentralization isn't an end in and of itself, but rather a means to censorship resistance, just as it is in the example of Bitcoin. For example, when it comes to money, you're sort of becoming independent from the Fed, printing tons of money and doing what they want in monetary policy and things like that. In this case, it's controlling, making sure that no one's in control of what you're allowed to post or what platforms you're allowed to be on and things like this and having the option to exit and participate in whatever platforms you want basically and have your audience have that direct relationship that you mentioned. So sufficient decentralization, I think, is a very interesting way to sort of attack that issue because what it's clearly not is maximal decentralization. You're with Forkaster, you're not attempting to have every individual post on the blockchain, which can create scaling issues and things like this. And I think if I can draw an analogy with Coinbase and you can maybe tell me how on or off this might be, but Coinbase in the early days made a very contrarian decision in a space that was crypto or really just Bitcoin at the time that was very much pro-decentralization and anti-regulation to create a centralized exchange, opposing decentralization in some sense and appreciating decentralization, but being a centralized exchange was just a naturally sort of opposite move and then embracing regulators and trying to educate regulators in, again, a space that was generally anti-regulation. Forkaster, I think, is taking a space that, again, is largely decentralized and saying, well, we don't need to be maximally decentralized. We'll sort of decentralize the registry and you can create your profile or your handle in a way that is decentralized, but we'll go and actually, you know, we'll start by hosting the messages ourselves, similar to like Coinbase hosting your funds. But the difference is on like Twitter, you know, you can take these anytime and exit, just like on Coinbase, you could take your funds and go to self-custody. On Forkaster, I imagine sort of in the future, you can take your, if not already, you can take your, you know, go from being hosted on Forkaster to hosting yourself. Is that a reasonable analogy? And how did you ultimately come to that decision of like, what do we actually need to decentralize here and what is okay to keep centralized? A couple of things. The first is an excellent book by Tim Wu called The Master Switch, which talks about the history of communications technologies. And the core point of the book is that most new communications technologies start out decentralized, hobbyists, tinkerers, small businesses, and naturally centralized. And the core reason is the centralized bigger companies, and you know, whether it's phone or television or in case, you know, social media recently, is they offer superior user experience and there's economies of scale. And so you get all these benefits that start to compound. And I think that that is an important framework to realize that basically an indication that consumer preference is for superior user experience. And I think that if you start with the belief that actually people want decentralization, that is you're not rooted in the correct average consumer psychology. Like that consumers care about user experience and Clayton Christensen's jobs to be done framework, I think is pretty good in that. And it's like, if something has a superior user experience and is satisfying whatever the consumer's job to be done, they're probably gonna use that. And so I think that that is important to think about. And then the second one is something that I lived at Coinbase is you could see that even though Bitcoin and cryptocurrency broadly is a decentralizing force, the revealed preference of consumers is to, yes, I wanna get involved, I wanna buy some Bitcoin or ETH, but I don't really wanna figure everything else out. So I'm willing to sign up with Coinbase which offers a pretty good user experience for someone onboarding into crypto. And that's about it. They never withdraw their Bitcoin or ETH. They don't go use a user controlled wallet. All of that stuff is, I still think very much in the realm of power users, early adopters, people who genuinely find experimenting with stuff fun. And so by taking kind of those two things, I think where you should start, if you're trying to increase decentralization for a given system, is start with the current paradigm which I'm assuming is gonna be centralized. And then if you think of the spectrum of centralization to decentralization, work your way from the centralized point down that line to the point where you hit what we would call sufficient centralization. And in my mind, it's you keep all of the benefits of centralization while adding an important characteristic of decentralization, which I would describe as exit with interoperability. And the way to think about that is, let's say you have a company, AcmeCo.com, and you sign up for a G Suite Google provided email service for your domain. And you really decide you don't wanna work with Google anymore and you wanna switch over to a Microsoft hosted email service. That operation is a, call it 30 minute process. And once you've switched the kind of pointer for the domain from Google to Microsoft, you have no interruption in your business. People who had your email address before can continue to send you email. And that forces Google and Microsoft, as well as all the other email providers to actually have to be responsive to customer needs and compete. And so that's this kind of idea that you can exit an existing provider and then interoperate with all of everything you were doing before. Another good example of this is in cell phone carriers. Prior to, and I think this was a law and I'm generally skeptical of most regulation, but in this case, this was good regulation in that the ability to switch phone number between cell providers actually makes those, that market a bit more competitive because now I can actually take a phone number which already people have in their contact book and I can switch it over from AT&T to Verizon or Verizon to Google Fi. And on the margin, I think that that makes the market more competitive versus having you locked in. And I think that the, in the case of cell phone providers is because the spectrum is actually limited. And so you can't just go create a new cell phone provider. But I think that this concept of exit interoperability is the thing that you want to in any system and try to get to actually a minimum level of decentralization that I think is sufficient. Is effectively what you're doing with exit with interoperability is you've created competition. In the case of Farcaster, and this works today, by the way, there's really only one client, it's the client that we've built because we've been spending the last two years working on this. So it's pretty polished. But Farcaster as a protocol will only be healthy when there is a sufficiently feature parity or competitive client that if anyone gets pissed at the way Dan and Varun are running our client, they can just simply switch to the other client. And that actually will force us as a company to be more responsive to customer user needs. And I think that is something that we think a lot about from the protocol standpoint. So I wouldn't be surprised that in the next year, like we put some substantial amount of work, whether it's through open sourcing a bunch of stuff, we're actually potentially even funding another team to build a competitive client. Because until that hits that point, we don't really have a protocol. We have, yes, like the foundations of a protocol and the ability to kind of say, hey, the APIs and data are open. But if for whatever reason, we have to kick a user off of our client for some terms of service violation, where are they practically gonna go? And if they can't go anywhere else, then you actually haven't hit that level of a protocol. Compare that to the web, right? So if not that this happens, but if Google Chrome really didn't wanna work with you, you could use Safari, you could use Firefox, you could use, pick your favorite browser. And so that I think is really, really important to hit if you're trying to build a protocol. And this is beyond just Forecaster, but anyone building a protocol needs to hit that level before they can really start calling it a protocol. So just to take this example a couple of steps further, and actually, first of all, do you have a couple more minutes? Yeah, yeah, I can go till, you know, whatever time. All right, cool. Great, well, I mean, this is really interesting. I've been really enjoying Forecaster, like I said, so it's great to be able to ask a few questions and I'm sure people listening are interested as well. So just to walk a bit further with that example, we don't need to use Trump per se, you know, people are unnecessarily divided on that, but, you know, user XYZ is on Forecaster today. And for whatever reason, you know, does something totally just against all of your values and principles and you decide, you know, he's not welcome on the Forecaster client anymore. You know, this is like two or three years from now, something like that. But he's okay on the protocol because everyone's okay on the protocol, basically. So how does that guy or girl, you know, continue to reach his audience, assuming that there's some competitive clients out there, are these people, you know, if he has a following on Forecaster, the client, are those people now forced to go somewhere else to view his content or how does that actually look like logistically? Each client is going to have to make that decision for themselves, but given that we're building the initial client, I think we will have a lot of influence in terms of what the default pattern for this will be. But I like to use the web as a good analogy for this. So when you get kicked off, like our Forecaster client, Merkle Manufacturers is our company name, we need to name that client something not Forecaster at some point so that it's very clear that there's a separate protocol versus client, right? Gmail and email are very clear that one is different than the other. But if you get kicked off our client and you are continuing to use the protocol, that to me should just be no different than the way a web browser handles the difference between being on the web and being on the client. And that's the difference between being indexed by Google and a URL, right? So let's say you have some reprehensible content, I don't even know. Google decides not to index your webpage. Everyone understands that Google has every right to decide what pages it indexes, right? That's like their prerogative, they're competing search engines. Yes, Google is the biggest, but no one is confused that if Google doesn't have your webpage indexed that you as the website operator go direct to your audience and say, hey, we'll go to my.com, like that's how you get to that webpage. And I think that that similarly should happen with Forecaster clients where you can imagine that the distribution you get from a recast or whatever algorithm a client has, that might go to zero because that's essentially proprietary to that client, that's not at a protocol level. But you can imagine that if you're following someone who's been kicked off that client, instead of showing it in feed, you could say, hey, there was a post from this user, we don't index that content in the same way that Google doesn't index a webpage, but it might let you know that if you tap a button, it'll kick you out to the browser and it'll open up that piece of content, right? And so that becomes a pretty reasonable trade-off in that you haven't censored an individual, but you are not giving them a premium user experience and the virality of like a social feed. And I think that the counter to the client there in terms of a market force is if you get too aggressive in doing this kind of like, oh, you're not allowed to be on the client, you're not allowed to be on the client, you're gonna have some subset of users who are saying, hey, I'm an adult, I wanna be able to look at what I wanna look at. And I'm gonna go use a different client, whether it's a competing company or an open source client. And that's the way the web works, right? So we're not at a place yet where Google takes Chrome and it says, oh, this webpage isn't allowed to be viewed in Chrome. The only time they do that is if you don't have your security certificate properly set up. So maybe it changes web browsers, but I think web browsers are a much healthier ecosystem. And the reason I don't think people complain about web browsers not censoring web pages is because distribution and hosting are separated, right? And I think that the challenge with centralized social media is if I put a tweet up, that tweet is fundamentally linked to an identity that's owned by Twitter, to a hosted set of media and files, text that Twitter is hosting, as well as Twitter's virality of its feed and its content moderation policy. So in a protocol-based system, you can actually separate different parts of the stack there and hosting can be in one place, distribution is in another, content moderation is in another, and ultimately the identity doesn't belong to anyone and it actually lives in this kind of low-level core smart contract. And for us, that's actually a reasonable use of a blockchain because you can actually write software that can run forever, that doesn't need to be paid for on an AWS bill, right? Once you've deployed a smart contract, you can effectively have the users, by virtue of them registering the username, pay for the ongoing use of that contract. And so that's actually, to me, a really powerful example of where a blockchain is superior to a kind of centralized experience because you've taken that core primitive out of any one company or individual's control and you've kind of put it in this neutral, very simple protocol that has no opinion about what content gets posted. It's just a mapping of a username to a private key or a public key. Yeah, I know that definitely helps sort of paint the picture for me. And of course, it's always difficult, if not impossible to sort of predict how these things are gonna play out. But I think your vision for all of it is obviously, founded in a lot of knowledge about history of all of these various protocols and platforms and deep understanding from a decade and a half of experience on Twitter and consuming RSS and generally information on the internet. So it's gonna be very interesting. And I know a big part of your guys pitch as well is, or maybe not pitch, but just the way you're thinking about things is like, it's not totally up to you to invent this future. You're just sort of building the protocol and the initial platform that can get sort of critical mass of people involved and then open it up to the devs, decentralized developers basically, to go and build whatever they want on it and sort of invent the future, collaboratively and in a decentralized manner. And I'm just, decentralized maybe overused term a little bit but just in a way that it's not all the people from one team who are building this ecosystem. It's a bunch of different people with a bunch of different ideas and whoever creates the best products ultimately should win. So I think it's really interesting, but you guys, as you mentioned, felt it's very important to start with building the first platform and building the first client. And right now, protocol is called Farcaster. The platform is also called Farcaster. And I've been on for a couple of months, like I mentioned at the top of the show and have just found it to be a very refreshing place to go read stuff on the internet or whatever and communicate with people comparably to Twitter. I was much later on Twitter than you were, but you've sort of seen the evolution over a decade and a half or the devolution more recently, you could argue. But I think Farcaster is somehow, there's no bots, there's no spam. The people have been sort of hand curated by you to a few thousand or however many there are today. Can you talk about how you've, first of all, why is it important to curate so carefully that initial community? And I'm sort of surprised by how high quality it is, given that my understanding is like, it's basically just DM you.

# POD OF JAKE ｜ #117  - DAN ROMERO [Nug2zLP8GpI]_part4

you and you're good for the most part, unless it's obviously a spam bot or something like that. But I'm curious to hear how you've gone about strategically curating this initial community and why that's been so important. We've changed our approach a little bit over the last year. We've been running the beta for about a year now. And the initial approach was I reached out to a bunch of people in my network. I've worked in crypto for almost eight years now. And the kind of time I spent in Silicon Valley, so I onboarded the first 400 people to Farcaster with a Zoom call. So kind of superhuman style, 15 minutes, explain what we were doing, kind of how the architecture worked, and then went through an onboarding where we did a screen share. And it was a desktop client to start, so it was kind of easy to do that. And what was interesting is we had a bunch of churn. These people all knew me, good friends in some cases, but I think a lot of them had existing Twitter audiences and the conversational liquidity was just too low. It was mostly me posting. And I think what ended up starting to work a little bit better was there were a few people of those 400 that stuck around and it was resonating for whatever reason. And they became pretty passionate about saying, hey, you should check out Farcaster. This seems pretty cool. And the next wave of call, another 500-ish or so, were mostly referrals. And I think they retained at a better rate than the initial because they tended to be people who were friends with the people who this resonated with. And on average, I think most of these people don't have existing big Twitter audiences, so their opportunity cost to switch was lower. And that's an interesting point because there's an essay from a friend, Eugene Way, called Status as a Service that I highly recommend everyone read that talks about this. But basically new social networks appeal to people who aren't already in the call it nobility of whatever social network before it. And there's this proof of work in the early days in terms of you kind of earning your chops to build the audience that ultimately compounds it as the network starts to grow. And so that very much played out with Farcaster. But I do think that the other strategy that we shifted over to probably in the last four months, five months, is this DM me on Twitter. And we've added a lot of friction to the signup flow. So what we get out of that is we get really high intent users. And I get plenty of spam Twitter accounts that send me, you know, I would like an invite to Farcaster. But what's interesting is, you know, I follow, I don't know how many people at this point, a thousand people on Twitter, and a lot of people in the crypto world. A lot of people I don't even know, I just, you know, see an account, they get retweeted, they seem to be into crypto, I click yes. And so I get an interesting sample that if you DM me, I can actually see do we have any mutuals in the sense of people I'm following who follow you. And then similarly, just the ability to just go back and forth over to direct messages creates a friction for it is very hard for a bot. I don't know, I don't think I'm failing the Turing test quite yet. But I think you have to be a little bit more intentional. And what's interesting is I basically let anyone in that I kind of pass as a like, okay, you seem like a reasonable human, I can see your public tweets, right? And usually probably don't let an account that's like one month old on Twitter onto Farcaster. And so I think it's worked really well in terms of this kind of curated community. But at some point in the last, you know, four to six months, the conversational liquidity flipped, and it got to a point where it wasn't just me posting a lot. I still post quite a bit, but it got to the point where you could refresh the feed if you're following enough people, and you get new content. And now we're to the point where I still follow everyone on the network for the most part, just a little over 3000 people, and I can't keep up with the feed. Like so it's actually being used during kind of, you know, day, daytime hours, at a rate that is faster than my Twitter feed refreshes, which is kind of wild. So I think we have hit a conversational liquidity point, which is exciting, because that actually is a good launching point for people to want to build apps, there's actually enough data, like real data, in terms of people posting and all the stuff that's associated with that. And I think that the other thing about conversational liquidity, similar to financial liquidity, which I learned a lot about at Coinbase, is liquidity begets liquidity. So now people are actually pinging me on Twitter DM and saying, hey, someone showed me Farcaster at a conference on their phone, and it looked really cool. Can I check it out now? And so the idea that you can actually get to a point where the app can actually be its own advertisement through these referrals, beyond just someone who's really passionate about it, that's been working. And then more recently, it's actually, we've had a lot of these organic tweets, where someone who had reached out to me via DM, onboards to Farcaster, really enjoys their initial experience, then tweets. And then all I've been doing is just retweeting that, or maybe I sometimes quote tweet it with a comment. And it inevitably brings in more people, because they're seeing it's not just me talking about how great Farcaster is, it's actually some other person that, if you see three or four of those endorsements, you're like, okay, might as well check it out. And so, so far, it's been working pretty well. I do think we're going to have a challenge beyond maybe call it 10,000. So we could probably keep doing this strategy for the next few months. But I think beyond 10,000 users signed up, I think we're gonna have to think through new growth strategies. And I always think in orders of magnitude, and I think this peters out at some point. And I think going from 10,000 to 100,000, while trying to maintain some semblance of quality is, I don't have an answer for you, but it's something that we're starting to think about. Yeah, is there any like, milestone that you have in mind in terms of like you mentioned, you know, you have friends who have huge followings on Twitter, and you get them and they're excited about Farcaster, it's, you know, sufficiently decentralized social network, they're all about that, like philosophically and, and everything like that. But, you know, like you mentioned earlier, people just sort of, they can sort of say what they want, or, you know, have these beliefs that they want, but at the end of the day, they sort of just want the experience. And if you have a million people following you on Twitter, and you know, 110 on Farcaster, it's sort of hard to convince yourself to like spend time there as someone who's already really, really established on Twitter. And of course, you can build a huge social network without those people. By definition, the vast majority of people on social media or Twitter specifically, you know, don't have a million, let alone 100,000, let alone 10,000, or even 1000 followers. But at the end of the day, you know, in the long run, you probably want some of these people to come over. So, you know, maybe for example, one milestone could be like, get someone with XYZ number of followers, you know, 100,000, a million to go like full time Farcaster where they're not even tweeting anymore at all, like maybe they spend some time doing both, which like that's currently where I am, right? Like, I'm not willing to stop tweeting to just use Farcaster exclusively right now. But I'm more than happy to post across both. And it feels like a great use of my time because there's an awesome group of people that I've mentioned on Farcaster. And I actually, you know, with like, for my own example, I probably have what, one tenth or even a bit less of the number of followers on Farcaster as I do on Twitter. And yet I find that like for the average post, it's actually better quantity and quality of engagement. So quantity in terms of like, you know, faves and things like this, and then quality in terms of like genuine comments. You can ask a question on Farcaster and you get like real answers versus Twitter. It's like sort of posting into a void a lot of times, or if you do have sufficient following, it's not a void, but it's like a spam, you know, universal spam or whatever. Everyone's just scam posting and things like this. So anyway, I guess that's a long-winded way of asking like, are there any particular goals that you have in mind or just keep executing the processes that you've been running and continue to figure things out as you go? I think I got a little bit more hung up on this last year. And I spent a lot of cycles thinking through, you know, I'm friends with biology and folks like that. And it's like, okay, you're ideologically aligned with something like this. And like, how do I get you to switch full time? But the more I actually think about it from first principles, that threshold is going to be pretty far because of that reach that you have on Twitter, whatever you're trying to do, that's like potentially very valuable, right? The most extreme example of this is obviously Elon, right? Elon's Twitter account is probably, I don't even think Tesla has marketing, right? It's like all of his companies benefit from the fact that he has this massive amount of distribution. So I think I underrated the value of distribution for people on something like Twitter for just like pure professional or gaining additional status. That said, it's something you brought up and I think we will be in a position to quantify this a little bit better over the next six months. But it's the engagement that you can get for the exact same post between Farcaster and Twitter that I think will start to win people over. And if we can continue to focus on quality of signups, so yeah, aggregate total number of followers is going to be smaller. But there was a post today, for example, my friend Jackson, he posted something on Twitter. It was a screenshot essay about just like the frontier of tech and crypto. And I think he got something in the order of 30 something likes and it might be higher now and no replies. And on Farcaster he posted and within 20 minutes he had four replies and there was actually a pretty substantial discussion that happened where it continued to go down the tree in a different direction. And so it was just generating a lot of engagement from people having very thoughtful answers and ways of engaging. And I think that in and of itself is like if you're strictly for the, I want to be able to say I tweeted something out to 100,000 plus people, sure. But if you actually are using the social network for having a real conversation or improving your ideas, I think Farcaster with a very small user base is going to be able to meet or exceed that on average for most people within the next year. And I think that is something to just continue to focus on. And a lot of people actually mentioned that Farcaster feels like early Quora. And the reason I think they say that is that early Quora had very thoughtful replies from a variety of people. And so I think we're not, no guarantees that we can continue to maintain that. But I think deeply from, or I'm thinking deeply about product decisions that we can make that can enhance that and even increase the amount of engagement people get. Because I actually do like this pretty basic indication that like, oh, I read this, I liked it. It's kind of almost like a read receipt. Whereas I think a reply, especially a thoughtful one, that's a lot more effort. And so quantifying the level of engagement per cast relative to the amount of followers people have, I think is an area that we're probably going to double down on. Yeah, I feel like part of it to your point on likes being somewhat like read receipts, I feel like that's just the default response. I mean, the default response, I guess, is to not interact with the tweet that you see at all. And then the default too is to like it if there's sort of any reaction to it positively, basically. And the comment, like almost, I think for a lot of people isn't even a consideration. Whereas on Farcaster, there's a lot of casts that are, you know, posed as questions or soliciting feedback. And it feels like, in a way, commenting is just as equal of a default almost as liking and or faving or whatever. And I don't know, it's like, I don't know how this is going to scale. And to your point, it's going to be definitely a challenge to get, you know, from 10,000 to 100,000, a very different breed of challenge than it was to get to the first thousand and then 1,000 to 10. But it'll be interesting to see how all of this sort of adapts with scale. But certainly for people listening now, I think it's a worthwhile experiment to go get involved with, especially if you don't have a huge following on Twitter, you got nothing to lose, like we've been talking about. So, you know, DM Dan and check it out as long as you're not a bot. But if you're listening, you're probably not a bot. All right. So I want to transition a little bit in closing with a couple of questions on not like personal necessarily very much related to all of this that we're talking about, but not like as exclusively focused on Farcaster. And the first is, well, I mean, this one is sort of focused on Farcaster to some extent, but I'm curious, like just as a founder building a social media platform and a protocol, you know, it's part of your job. Like you said, in the early days, you basically were the feed. And that's less and less the case as you're getting this conversational liquidity. But, you know, being on the platform and interacting on social media, Farcaster in particular, but also Twitter and being in your DMs and things, this is all like very much a part of your job. It's like something that is very beneficial to what you're building. And it's something you have to do and might enjoy doing. But social media is inherently a huge distraction. In addition to all of the great value that it has, it's just a distraction for a lot of people as well. And sort of the, you know, double sided sword or whatever you call it. So how do you manage like, you know, are there any rules you put in place for yourself on like, OK, I'm going to go and and binge for this number of hours at this time and then shut it down for the day? I'm curious just how you manage that thing that for a lot of people like there's no, you know, there's value to being on social networks, but there's not as direct value as building the company. So I'm curious how you balance that as you know, as you're building. Yeah, I think it's definitely a struggle in that sometimes when I'm using Farcaster, I'm wondering, OK, is this actually the best use of my time? But the reality is using your own product and being as much of a power user as anyone on the platform gives you a deeper understanding about the product for that when you do some of that product thinking or shifting over towards like, what should we be building and how you have a very deep, intuitive sense on what works and what doesn't. I think the other thing to consider is so there are different phases of building product for social network, but I suspect that we have shifted for Farcaster is very much right now is actually building the community. And I don't love that word because it's like got a lot of meanings for different people, but or the network, maybe is a better term for it. Is what so when I'm putting effort into to fostering the network or answering people's questions, it creates an interaction that says, OK, this is actually much more human than maybe the kind of void that is the centralized social media or something like a Twitter. So that that in of itself is actually building the company in some ways. And I think it's hard to say, oh, well, just just hire an intern and have them answer people's questions. I don't think it has the same same effect. So in some ways, it goes back to a Paul Graham. I say to do things that don't scale. I don't think you do it forever at the rate that I'm doing it just because I think the network will scale and it's like, OK, then I'll just have to be selective. But I don't think that ever goes away because the moment I stop really engaging at a deep level in the network, I'm going to actually lose the pulse of kind of like how things are going. Like you can only look at so many metrics, dashboards and things like that. I think that the other thing with the kind of like distracting component of social media, and this is one of the reasons I love RSS. So in RSS, you have RSS readers, right? And there's a variety of clients that tend to be in the in the sense that they're not venture backed. And and so a lot of them are either you pay for the software or you subscribe to the software. I use one called Feedbin and I actually have different clients on my iPhone and on my Mac. And so I spent a decent amount of money on software related RSS. But what's cool about it is you get a lot of configurability because the developer to customer relationship is not one of time spent, which ultimately translates into ads. It's one of trying to give you as much utility. And I think that that is an underrated thing that we really haven't explored yet, given that the dominant mode of social networks that won over the last 10 years were all advertising driven. But if you just just use television as an example, think about how wild it is to go and watch network television now, where for any given TV show, you would have a 30 minute slot spend seven minutes watching commercials, right? Post Netflix, which obviously now is adding ads, but Netflix and HBO and like that is a superior user experience. I pay you and I can get the maximum amount of time. And so I suspect what will happen with Farcaster as both with our client, but as more clients start to get billed, is you're going to have developers that offer products that make a different set of trade offs. And there will definitely be a market for people who are willing to trade their time for ads in order to be free. But I can promise you if Twitter offered me a $20 a month subscription, where I could not have to see a single ad, then I would do it. I would do the same thing with Google. I do it with already with YouTube. And what's interesting though, is when you're an advertising based business, you don't want your best customers to shift over to the paid version because now the advertiser is saying, wait a second. So I'm only showing ads to the not as good customers. And look, it's sort of worked for Spotify, but the reality is I think Spotify is much more driven. I don't know the specifics of their financials, but much more driven by their subscription revenue than their free advertising tier. And it's like advertising tier is actually top of funnel to get people to actually upgrade into the subscription tier. And so I think that going back to your point, you could end up in an era where there are five, six Farkaster clients that what they optimize for is given that you might be a subscriber, how much signal to noise ratio they can optimize and save you time. So rather than time spent at saying, hey, rather than spending 10 minutes a day using Farkaster, we're going to shoot to have you only spend eight and we're just going to do a better job through machine learning or whatever to show you exactly the right content and no more. And we don't want you to do scroll. And so I think that's just an interesting model when you actually have business model diversity as a result of permissionless innovation and it being a protocol. Yeah, that's really interesting. I mean, I can't imagine there's obviously there's the ad based model and the subscription model. I think all the reasons you've pointed to as to why subscription is likely superior for for the consumer, at least when it comes to social networks is, you know, that all makes sense. But there's probably a whole nother category of business models that can sort of be incorporated and invented with with crypto and tying that all into everything.

# POD OF JAKE ｜ #117  - DAN ROMERO [Nug2zLP8GpI]_part5

where I can't even really imagine or speculate on what those might be. But there might be a bunch of different models that people can come on and experiment with. And like we talked about earlier, whoever creates the best models likely win. And hopefully it's not quite as power law as sort of the centralized landscape today, but I'm sure there'll be a few platforms that sort of dominate to some extent. Last question for you, you talked about using, I think it was called Feedbin for your RSS reader. I know you've been sort of prolific. I think you've called yourself an Infovore and grew up, I understand, reading a lot of newspapers and then always been reading tons of books and RSS and Twitter for 15 years. If there's anyone I'd like to ask about how they craft their information diet and think about what they're consuming and what information they're intaking, I think you're as good of a candidate as I could think about. So I'm curious, beyond the RSS feed, any sort of principles you have or observations you can reflect on from the development of your information diet over time? Like you also mentioned Fred Wilson's blog and Chris Dixon's and Mark Andreessen, these are a lot of the same people that I'm interested in reading and have read their blogs as well. So I'm curious just to hear about the development of your information diet over time. Yeah, a couple of rules. My Twitter account has shifted a little bit because I'm spending so much more time on Forrecaster that I spend a lot less time on Twitter. For a long time, I only followed 100 people on Twitter and was pretty maniacal about trying to use it as reverse chronological feed. And if you approach it like that, if people post too much stuff that you don't like, you just unfollow them. I'm now in the place where I follow a thousand people and part of it is so that I can get signal into people getting invited to Forcaster. So it's an algo feed there and I find it infuriating. It would be interesting actually if you could tune your own algorithm in a way that you could explicitly say, don't do this, don't do that. So I'm a little bit more rules-based than machine learning, but I don't know, maybe if you get to multiple clients in an ecosystem, one team could actually build a machine learning algorithm that would make me satisfied. So I tend to be more oriented towards my RSS feeds as well as newsletters, which I think Substack has really taken up a ton of share in terms of my information diet. I think the honest answer is since I've been working at Forcaster, I've spent less and less time outside of just consuming information on Forcaster. I do think that the nice thing about an RSS reader is I have a couple of folders of just high priority blogs. So like Marginal Revolution I've been reading for a decade, Darren Fireball, the same thing. And so there's just a set of blogs that I've tuned over time that I know they don't post too many times a day and basically everything they post is high signal. And I tend not to follow as much news because I actually think news is pretty commodity. And I think Paul Graham made a good observation of this is that you can actually follow the news on more of a weekly basis than a daily basis and get pretty much the same amount of information. And I think that if anything, you improve it because you get higher signal, right? Things actually take a couple of days and you get the actual facts start to come out. I think the other thing that is if you've just spent enough time reading stuff on the internet, like tech news for me, I can go to techmeme.com and I can just flip the bits, so to speak, in that I don't even need to click through to most of the stories. I can just read the headline and wait both what that means, like, oh, okay, Adobe sold the Figma for 20 billion. I really don't need to get into all these details. But I can just update all the different parts of my brain of like, okay, what does that actually mean? How do I think about startups, a startup that's deliberate for the first few years about building rather than... So that's how I kind of approached my information diet rather than deeply engaging with every piece. And I really try to save the decision power that is required to actually think to really dig in on an essay, is I try to put a couple of those for the weekend. And I've never been a really good user of something like Instapaper or Pocket, but I just email myself a couple of those things and I just leave them in my inbox, which is my to-do list. And then on a weekend, in a quiet moment, I just try to actually spend some time to read through an essay or two. But I think that the nice thing about building something like Farcaster is a lot of people share interesting stuff on Farcaster. And one of the reasons I really like screenshot essays is it's not as long as a well-thought-out essay or even a book. But the promise that you get with a screenshot essay compared to something like a Twitter thread is I know that if I click this thing open, the approximate amount of time for me to read a screenshot, like a single screenshot of text, is defined. And I think that there's also a benefit to having that constraint in terms of making your point, which is longer than a small in-feed text unit, but shorter than a normal blog post. And so I'm selfishly hoping more people try to post things that are, again, longer than a tweet length, but as long as something on Substack, just so that I can consume more interesting points of view without spending necessarily the time. Yeah, those are lots of great strategies. I sort of, like I mentioned, I pegged you as a good person to ask about this, but that even exceeded any response that I could have expected about sort of some principles and just ways to systematize how you interpret data and collect information and all of that. So really interesting. And Dan, again, I want to thank you for coming on. We'll wrap up here because we've gone sufficiently over talking about the sufficiently decentralized social network. But where can people go to, how do you want to instruct them to get involved or follow along? Should they DM you on Twitter still? Or how can people follow the future of Farcaster? And then also if you're comfortable, I don't know, I think it'll be, you know, this podcast won't go out for another week or so. So you'll have shipped what I understand is a pretty good feature. So if you want to talk about that in closing as well, that'd be great. Yeah. So if anyone wants to get access to Farcaster, DM me on Twitter. I'm DWR. And just say that you heard the pod and that'll be a good sign that you're not a bot. I think the feature that we're releasing on Wednesday, assuming everything lands is DM. So we're not actually calling direct messages. We're calling them direct casts because everything on Farcaster should just be a cast and you're either doing a broadcast, which is public or a direct cast, which is private, but hoping to have that in place in the next two days.

# Sufficient Decentralization — Dan Romero [F3bbrFesZDo]_part1

what is the right model that we can actually figure out so that these systems, to your point, where actually everyone has a say based on the value they contribute or the usage or whatever the right metric is. Hello friends, Jess here from C-Club. Welcome to season three of Building at the Edges. We host conversations with the top innovators, thinkers, and builders at the intersection of crypto and community. Today I'm bringing you a conversation with Dan Romero. Dan is the co-founder at Farcaster, a sufficiently decentralized social network. You might've heard of it referred to as the Purple App. This conversation with Dan, we get into, well, him defining what all that means. What is a social network? What is a sufficiently decentralized social network? How does he imagine the business model around Farcaster evolving? What does ownership in a decentralized or sufficiently decentralized social network look like? Try to get an understanding of where he sees the value in Farcaster versus Web2 apps like Twitter or Facebook. What are the differences? Why might you want to participate in one versus the other? I think back to the early days of social media when I was first jumping onto Twitter and all the questions I would have had for Jack and for Ev who were building that app and just really excited about this opportunity to sit down with Dan. And we get the inside scoop on how you can get an invite to Farcaster. Farcaster is only invite only at this point, but if you listen to the end, we'll give you some magic words and steps on how you can go get your username and access the network today. So make sure you listen right the way through though you're not gonna have a hard time doing it. It's an interesting conversation. Dan has just thought really deeply about this. And I think there's a lot to learn both in how he's taking this product to market, some of the trade-offs and ideas they have under the hood and what the future of decentralized or sufficiently decentralized social networking might look like. So let's get into it. Dan, welcome to the pod. Hey, thanks for having me. Okay, so I think for many people who are listening to this, they probably heard of Farcaster. They probably know a couple of people who use it. Maybe they've been following your Twitter account rather with probably notifications turned on to look for an invite. But I'm very curious, like how do you describe Farcaster to folks who maybe haven't heard of it before? Farcaster is a sufficiently decentralized social network and it makes two strong guarantees. The first is if you're a user of the network, you have a direct relationship with your audience and no individual, company, country can take that away from you. I think the analogy I always kind of use is with email. If you have an email newsletter and you use MailChimp or Substack and one of those platforms decides that they don't wanna work with you anymore, you're free to export all of your subscribers, move over to the other platform and go about sending your newsletter. Like your subscribers probably wouldn't even notice that you changed providers. Contrast that to another centralized social network like Twitter or YouTube and you spend 10 years building an audience there and for whatever reason, that network decides that they don't want you, you don't get to export your audience there. That audience actually is part of the terms of service of those networks. And so with Farcaster, it's more like email in the sense that anyone who chooses to follow you, that is a kind of directional relationship between that person and you and so if you were to change clients on the Farcaster network, you would still be able to kind of reach all of the people who have opted into following you. And then the second guarantee for the network is that as a developer, you have direct access to the underlying data and APIs of the network. And I think to use another example from the past, Twitter used to have a pretty vibrant third-party developer ecosystem. There were a lot of third-party Twitter clients. Pull the refresh is my favorite example. That was invented by a third-party Twitter client called Tweety, which ended up getting acquired by Twitter. So many people don't even know this. Twitter has the patent for pull the refresh, kind of like Amazon has the one-click checkout. And honorably, they have actually made it kind of a, you know, anyone can use this. And so basically every app has pulled the refresh now. But that was actually because Twitter had this really permissive API. You had all these smart, creative developers playing around with like new ways to, and this is in the early 2010s when feeds were a little less mature on mobile. How best do you deal with refreshing a feed? And so that ecosystem evaporated overnight in, I think it was like 2014 or 2015, when Twitter reasonably like said, hey, we need to actually focus on monetization. We're gonna do that through ads. So in order to force people to look at the ads, we're gonna kind of hamstring the open APIs. There were a few other reasons that contributed to that, but it was the company was thinking about going public. They needed to kind of actually capture the time spent in their clients so they could show those ads. And so with Forecaster, you as a developer, if you wanna build an app, it can be open source, it can be a commercial service. You have full access to the data and APIs. And in the relationship, similar to kind of the user relationship, you as a developer, your relationship with users is between you and that user. So if I install your Seed Club client app that's built on top of Forecaster, there is no kind of corporate terms of service change that can come in and say, oh, sorry, that app no longer works with Forecaster and you, Dan, can't decide to use that app. And so I think that those are the two core components of the network. And effectively for us, if those things hold true, what we hope is over time, you're gonna have a whole ecosystem of apps and clients that allow people to choose what experience they want for this kind of public social network and kind of what trade-offs, what type of content moderation, algorithms, all of that stuff is gonna be very much consumer choice. And I think we've seen that with email or browsers that has led to better outcomes. It still actually has a lot of centralization in both of those markets. Like we can talk about that a little bit, but I think what's worth pointing out is Google Chrome came after Internet Explorer and Firefox, right? When they were dominant. And so I think that if you actually do build a mousetrap in those markets, people will actually adopt your offering. It might be hard, but you do actually have choice because those are built on permissionless decentralized protocols. So I think you used the word a sufficiently decentralized social network. I'm assuming some of those sort of rules that you've been placed or were sharing there are kind of part of that definition of sufficiently decentralized, but perhaps you can sort of expand on what that means. And then I think maybe touching on where those points of centralization exist in email might be an interesting context to dive into. My co-founder Varun wrote a blog post at the beginning of this year called sufficient decentralization and social networks. And for us, what we were trying to communicate is our philosophy around when you're trying to kind of build one of these new networks, if you view centralization and decentralization as a spectrum, if you optimize everything for decentralization, which I think if you kind of listen to maybe some of the rhetoric and the ideological components of crypto, and I think just broadly cyberpunk culture, and I think you get to maybe an ideal state for some, but from a practical use it every day, especially for mainstream users, I think it's too difficult. And then similarly, the centralization side, you get massively improved user experience. I don't think anyone is saying that the execution on product details for the kind of major social networks are bad. I think some of their kind of like product strategy and like how they monetize result in some bad decisions, but overall, like using Instagram, the performance of that feed is pretty incredible. If you think about just like you can endlessly scroll it and just like the delivery of the content or YouTube, the ability for it to just kind of play really high quality content within a click on your phone, a lot of that is the benefits of centralization. But I think that the downside of centralization is you're forced into business models and potential choices from a strategic standpoint, such as not having third-party clients that can be really frustrating for consumers. And then especially if you're either a developer or someone trying to build an audience, that is even worse if you suddenly overnight either lose the app that you were building on top of that platform or your audience. And so from our standpoint, what you do is you actually wanna start with the user experience, which is what gets people to use stuff, which is the lifeblood of any of these networks, and then work your way towards decentralization to the point where, and it's a little squishy, you deem it, it's sufficiently decentralized. And so from our point of view, the thing that's most important about a network like Twitter is the kind of core identity primitive of saying, I am X and this is where people who want to follow me can find me, that like kind of digital pointer, similar to a domain name, that needs to be decentralized because then if you were to leave any one service provider, to go back to the email analogy, if I have a newsletter, danromero.org, and I wanna send email from that domain, because of the way both DNS, the domain name system and email work, I can just change a little record with my domain registrar, then it's called an MX record. And by doing so, I can just simply change the server that's actually sending my mail out and then the system will work. And so I think from our standpoint, that is actually a sufficiently decentralized system in the sense that it's not like you're running your own mail server when you're using one of these kind of newsletter tools, you're actually using a corporate tool, like they have terms of service, they can kick you off, but because you have the ability to exit that centralized service and interoperate with all the other email addresses out there, that I think helps enable this concept of sufficient decentralization. And one interesting thing to think about email is despite it being kind of a permissionless, decentralized protocol, right? It's existed for a really long time. The way the market works today is it's actually a couple of large email providers, the big consumer ones like Gmail and Microsoft and Yahoo, but also you have a couple of like the, call it developer oriented email systems. So something like Amazon or I think SendGrid's another one. And the deliverability of any given email that is being sent is actually not like, kind of like an egalitarian thing. So if you run your own mail server in your basement and you have a new domain, say you registered, you know, a new dot X, Y, Z domain for your cool new company, good luck trying to get any of those emails to show up in the inbox, right? So the default is just like, sorry, like that's probably spam. We're not gonna make it land in the inbox, which if you just know how consumers work, if it's in spam, basically it doesn't exist. You have to have a very determined user to find it. And so that's actually something we think a lot about for Farcaster because despite what I just said about email before, there are natural tendencies as these networks develop over time to have new points of centralization and new points of potential failure for kind of like this exit with interoperability. And so one of the things that we're actually trying to think through as we design the Farcaster protocol, while theoretically the idea that the identity being the only thing that's like core promise of decentralization gets you to kind of a practical level of decentralization, it actually requires a little bit more where in terms of how Farcaster works, we have this concept called Farcaster hubs, which for those who are kind of into crypto, I think of it as like an Ethereum node for the Ethereum network, Farcaster hub is that for Farcaster kind of social content. But those Farcaster hubs also have to be something that we think through and make the right trade-offs to keep those decentralized. Because even if you take the identity primitive, which is the thing that actually lives on the Ethereum blockchain for Farcaster, if the hubs inevitably become centralized, it doesn't matter if the on-chain component is decentralized it's actually the point that ends up being most centralized is the place that you're gonna have all the problems. And I think another analogy in crypto that we're kind of working our way through right now, it hasn't really been a huge issue, is Ethereum post-proof of stake now has a couple of really large, what are they called validators or basically Coinbase and a couple of others. And there's a whole bunch of back and forth that's happening where people are talking about OFAC compliant blocks and whether or not the different kind of proof of stake operators are actually censoring transactions. And so that's a great example of where, yes, actually the distributed nature of Ethereum ownership checks the box for proof of stake to make it work. But the revealed preference of how people participate in proof of stake means that there's natural centralization. And so I don't think we have everything solved like by any means, it's like an ongoing process. But I do think one thing to think about in these systems is wherever you think you've solved the decentralization, you may have, but you may be creating a kind of like second order effect where there's now a new area that's the, call it the weakest point in your kind of game of decentralization versus centralization that you have to kind of game theory think through of like, how do you prevent this from getting too centralized? And to be fair, Bitcoin has actually had this for a long time, right? You have a very small number of mining pools that from a game theory standpoint, don't actually want to do double spends because it would actually lower the price of Bitcoin, which that's where they get their value. I think it's a really rich area for exploration and kind of thinking through these systems because it's not as deterministic as maybe an engineer would like it to be. Yeah, I think the deeper you go into these networks or even into DAOs, the harder it is to sort of parse where, I mean, there's just this natural centralization that happens purely based on relationships or on where value is flowing. And I like that approach of, you know, just sort of recognizing and attempting to address that where it's warranted or maybe most warranted. I think there's another piece of centralization that we think about from like a more consumer preference standpoint, which I think is a thing that I definitely want to dive into with you. Cause I think you've been very, at least from my point of view, you've been very pragmatic and focused on building useful experiences for members who join Farcaster. And I think there's some richness to get in there, but you know, this idea of exiting and being able to leave. And I guess like Ben Thompson talks about aggregation theory quite a bit, and it's sort of where attention aggregates is where value flows. And definitely that's built on sort of more web two business models, but like, does exit matter if where you're exiting to is a barren wasteland and nobody is there paying attention to you? Like, does this depend on there being a significant number of individuals using a front end and won't sort of Farcaster most likely just be that front end? I think it's spot on. And it's a question I think about all the time in that. So there's the centralization and then there is like, okay, is it like technically decentralized in the sense that do you have a second client? And then there is practical, right? So if I'm using the client, our company Merkle Manufacturing has built for Farcaster, and I spend a lot of time building an audience, and then there is no viable alternative. If for whatever reason, Merkle says, hey, we don't want you to use the client. We think you're behaving badly and like, we just don't want to do business with you. Well, if there is no alternative, then while technically you could write your own client, but you're not going to. And so then effectively what you have is a company with one client that has a very permissive open database. And so, and one of the reasons I think we've been so slow to kind of get to like kind of a broader public launch, there are a variety of reasons, but one of them is I think it's tough to go call yourself a protocol when you only have one client, especially with something like social, right? Ethereum, I think is a little different in the sense that like, okay, you can have multiple implementations of nodes, but as long as I can kind of run another node, I'm probably not going to get blocked because the default implementation, but I think it's worth thinking about that. I think going back to the consumer preference thing though, that's a really important point because there were two ways to frame it, is I think consumers, or if you want to take a kind of more negative connotation is consumers are lazy, just people are lazy in general. And so what they optimize for as a revealed preference, most of the time, most people, is convenience, which I think is actually just a more positive way of saying it's like you make something easy and convenient, people are going to use it. And I think like, if you look at the successful set of software internet companies, the ones that tend to win in the consumer space tend to make the most kind of like convenient, easy to use, intuitive experiences. And an interesting example of this is where I used to work, Coinbase, I spent the five years at Coinbase, and then even since everyone always talks about how Coinbase is so expensive, right? And it's like Coinbase also is holding your crypto, if you're a hardcore person, you're like not your keys, not your coins. And the reality is that Coinbase has 100 million customers and is still continuing to grow customers despite being twice as expensive as everybody else. And they're not giving you the full freedom that you would if you hold your own crypto with your own self-custodied wallet, because most people don't want to deal with the hassle and they're willing to pay a premium for convenience. And I actually think in some ways, this is why certain people just don't understand Apple, because they want to put everything into a kind of feature checklist. And Ben Thompson's written about this as well with what Clayton Christensen got wrong in terms of talking about the innovators dilemma and why Apple, despite being kind of this premium offering, hasn't been disrupted on the low end. And for those at home who don't know Clayton Christensen, he's a professor, used to be at Harvard Business School, I think he's since passed away. And he wrote this book called the Innovators Dilemma that just talks about how usually what happens in any given market is you have the kind of market leader tends to focus on the higher end of the market and then inevitably you have some kind of cheaper low end that comes in and then kind of works their way up the value chain and disrupts the incumbent. And it's kind of as like one of his last points in this framework is that he said that the iPhone was going to be disrupted by Android, just in the same way that the Windows, Windows, Intel, Microsoft, Intel, duopoly ended up eating through all of IBM and all this other kind of stuff. And that was wrong. If anything, Apple has actually gained share in developed markets. And the reason is that consumer preference, assuming you have some level of ability to afford it, is for convenience and the kind of product design and some of these other things. And so then kind of going back all the way to how that affects forecaster, I think one thing that we've had a strong belief since day one, and part of this, I think is informed by the Coinbase experience, is if you build a really well-designed and kind of convenient, easy to use user experience, that is actually going to be the single largest driver of usage for most people, right? Like there are always gonna be some ideologues who are willing to use the more technical thing because they really believe, and I actually really respect that. But I think if you just take the practical realities, most people don't have that level of energy or time. And so from our standpoint, and this goes back also to the sufficient decentralization point, is what we're trying to offer people with Forecaster, at least today for the early adopters, is just like make a better product experience that also happens to be built on top of decentralized protocol. Not a okay product experience, but it's built on a decentralized protocol because they're reveal preferences, they're not gonna use it. They're gonna continue to use Twitter or wherever else that they already have that habit. And so I think it's like a deep respect for, and this is actually, I think, something that people in crypto, web three, whatever you wanna call it, tend to dismiss is the web two companies, the reason they got so big is because they had a deep respect for that, those like kind of laws of consumer psychology and revealed preference. I think I may have said this, there's a stated preference, I ask you what you want, and then what do you actually do? And so I think that that's been a really informative thing in terms of how Varun and I have thought through some of the product challenges. And the famous line there obviously is, Henry Ford would say, if I'd asked my customers what they wanted, they would have wanted a faster horse. I think there's also a component that in Silicon Valley and then later internet product culture, Steve Jobs was famous for not asking people what they wanted, it's just know what people actually want. And there's definitely truth to that, especially when you're building consumer experiences, but there is this kind of thing where you have to pay attention to what actually the revealed preferences are from people, otherwise, you're just gonna sit there and you're kind of almost like a hipster. You're like, well, I built the thing that people should like, but they just happen to not use it. Well, it's like, okay, cool. Is an art project, like what's the goal? And if you're trying to build something that people are gonna wanna use every day, you really have to dial in on what are the revealed preferences of people. And then if you're trying to do that in a kind of protocol oriented way, it's like, how can you match the reveal preferences of people while still building in kind of this protocol first way at a time?

# Sufficient Decentralization — Dan Romero [F3bbrFesZDo]_part2

in a way that allows for the permissionless innovation and those strong guarantees I gave you before about like what makes a protocol great. So I guess just to push on that a little bit further, I'd sort of take what you've just said there. Sounds to me that the expectation is that most people will probably actually participate in Farcaster through the Farcaster client. You know, you are putting a ton of time and thoughtful design into this product. And so, and that if we sort of look at where maybe the stated preference that for users who are feel like they are current, say Twitter or YouTube social network landscape, isn't a space where they are able to be themselves for whatever reason, they say they wanna leave and go somewhere else. In reality, those places they go to are really like far inferior, not just from a technical perspective, but also like all the people who don't wanna hang out on Twitter, put them in one room, probably not a room I wanna go hang out in. And I don't think most people there would want to either. And so I guess just to get back to my point earlier, like why build this decentralized if you think that ultimately people are just going to use it through the main client? Yeah, so I think it will be like that for a while until it's not. I don't have like a specific threshold. I think it generally think in order of magnitude, so we have 4,500 people in a beta today. So somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000, maybe someone says, hey, this is worth my time to go build a competing client, even though that team has spent multiple years thinking about it and I maybe can learn some things. Maybe I clone what they've done and just kind of iterate on the edges. I think when you get to the 100,000 to a million people on the network, it becomes even more compelling to say, you know what, I actually think like it's worth it, even though that there's another funded team. Like I just have better ideas. I think that this is an underserved area. And then obviously if you get to a million to 10, like it just gets bigger and bigger. And so I think it can be simultaneously true where it's like, there's no point in competing with them. And then at the same time, it's actually, it's like, that's the massive opportunity. And I think we just have to be really focused on is one, holding up the ideals of the protocol where I gave you those two examples where it's like you really, as a user, if you want to switch to another client, you're going to continue to have all the same access to the audience that you built, right? So that actually encourages you to switch to another client. Simple example, I have a Gmail address. I don't switch from Gmail to other providers to even test them out because changing my email, even if I did forwarding, it just like, it's kind of a pain. Whereas if you use G Suite and you had your own domain, that actually becomes a little bit easier to do that, right? I think a second example on the developer side, and we're already starting to see this, people want features in the main client, our client. And we're saying like, hey, sorry, not a priority. So like a basic example of this one is GIFs and video and audio. People are really clamoring for that. We are a team of six. We have a lot of other stuff that we're trying to get done, probably not going to happen. And so like I could imagine someone building a much more rich multimedia oriented client. And I actually casted this recently saying, someone should just build a client that's really focused on music, right? People on Forkaster, it's a revealed preference. People are actually sharing links to music. They share links to YouTube music. People ask for music recommendations. They have music NFTs that are showing up in their wallets. You could make that client and it could be a team of one or two people, right? And you don't have to go raise a ton of money for that or whatever. And then the nice thing is the protocol is actually doing a lot of work for you, right? It's verifying all the posts, it's making sure all the identities are set up. So you've actually in some ways reduced the overhead that you need to do to bootstrap it. And you can use the main Forkaster client as your primary source of distribution. Hell, if you built that client, I probably am going to recast it and say, hey, look at this cool new Forkaster client. And so can you deterministically guarantee that we won't go evil? No, like it's not an intellectually honest answer, but I'm gonna continue to come on podcasts, say it on Forkaster everywhere. It's like the reason I'm working on this is I actually wanna build the protocol and I view it as a huge success. If we actually get to scale, where today we have 99% of client usage on the network. If we get to a point where you have a hundred million people using the network every day and we have 10% market share, that to me is a resounding success. Like that's something I can point back to and say, I actually helped build that. And I really believe that there is a way to thread the needle there. That said, if I put on the skeptics hat, there is no way that I wouldn't be skeptical listening to someone like myself on the, hey, I've watched every web two company say that they were gonna do this, and then they've turned around and screwed people over. And so that's just the reputation we have to earn. And there was an interesting conversation on Forkaster this weekend, where I was like kind of thinking through a product feature because I've been using more of Twitter's features just to kind of grok. Like traditionally I only followed a hundred people. Now I follow 2,500, I'm algo maxi now just to kind of understand all that. And the get notified when someone tweets feature. I posted that out, seemed like a lot of people are interested. And then I had a developer who rightfully was like, hey, I actually built this other tool. Well, like, should I stop working on it? And so I ended up having a really thoughtful offline conversation with this person. And I think we got to a good place of like understanding what he was trying to build and like what we were thinking about here. But I think it's like, there are gonna be hard situations where we need to figure that out. In the Apple parlance, it's called Sherlocking, where there's this kind of app that used to be what now is Mac OS Finder called Sherlock, right? Like look for your files. And since that app got killed by Apple making the first party, every year at WWDC, there's some set of apps that now kind of gets folded into the overall ecosystem. Like people forget like the flashlight app used to be a thriving ecosystem of like power flashlight apps that just basically turned your screen white before they even had the physical flash. So I think like we're never gonna be perfect on this, but I think we need to do our best to be a steward of the protocol while at the same time doing what I think is the single biggest service to the protocol is with our client, growing the number of addressable daily active users for the protocol. And if you actually think about Apple, that is the single most important thing that they do for the iOS ecosystem is sell iPhones, which are daily active by virtue of you or have it physically attached to you in your pocket. And people deal with the app store and all of the ring of morale, you know, the 30% cut, the like, you know, not allowing NFTs and all this other stuff, not because that's great, it's because it makes distribution for what they built like really easy. And so I think that that is the overarching thing that we really need to do is just continue to grow daily active users, not monthly, not signups, it's daily active. Because that means if you have someone who has an app on the home screen, that is someone who's now potentially gonna go check out another app in the ecosystem. And so that is the thing that we are trying to get in front of developers is like, hey, like we have real people, not spam bots. They're using the app basically every day. So you have as much of a shot at getting them to install your music client or something like that. I don't know if that answers your question. It's just something we're thinking about. And like, I think it's a really good critique of like the practical reality of where we are today, where we have one client that represents 99% of the usage of the network. It's like, we have to get that down over time if the protocol is gonna be successful. Yeah, I mean, I think it's fascinating to me because you know, I joined Twitter in 2007. And I think like my first graduated university came out just as the promise of social media was becoming a thing. I was an early blogger user and WordPress user and sort of this idea of democratizing media was the thing that was just so compelling. And I had run a small business before and I was like, the internet changes all of this. And then, you know, earlier than most really came up against the challenges of aggregation and centralization and sort of the business models ultimately that live in a Twitter more so in a Facebook and a YouTube. And so, and I think in the example earlier that, you know, I remember when Twitter had this thriving developer ecosystem. It felt like anybody could go and launch anything and have a shot at not only the core premise of Twitter being like, you can have your voice heard by anybody, but you could also have your tool or your startup. There's just like a lot more energy. And it's why I love crypto so much. I feel like that energy is here again in this new space. But the sort of closing down of the API was very much a business driven decision, right? It's an advertising business. I think they started to see a number of other clients get rolled up as somebody who's trying to go build a competing advertising business. And very much the incentives lived within, you know, Twitter Corp to close that down. And so I guess my question for you is like, how are you thinking about the business model or the economic model of Farcaster? And so far as it supports this grand vision that you're laying out. Yeah. So protocol and client. Let's talk about protocol for a second. In Farcaster V1 kind of had an identity primitive that was just a username. And there were a couple of issues with that. So in a decentralized follow model, if you tie all follows to a username, if you as the user want to upgrade your username, so let's say I was Dan Romero and I wanted to switch to DWR or D, I wouldn't be able to upgrade my username because I would need to then go get all of my followers. Imagine now you have multiple clients to go re-sign that follow. And so naturally we moved to a model where what is what you do with a centralized database is you have an ID number. So there's something called the Farcaster ID. It lives on chain. It's a one time, so just gas only fee. And it's just an integer that increments. So if you're the 33rd user on Farcaster, your FID is 33. So if you're old school, you remember ICQ where it just incremented every single number of user and that's fine. It's abstracted away from the user. It's how everything in the system works, but that's actually important because you can do it once and you can continue to use the network forever and never have to pay another thing. And so I think there's a little bit of friction there and a little bit of cost. We've actually built this kind of gasless onboarding so you don't even need any crypto to sign up and we'd cover the cost for you. I'd imagine over time, there are gonna be plenty of companies that are willing to kind of do that. But the nice thing is it also prevents a bunch of spam because if just by virtue of having to convince someone to pay for you, there's probably gonna be a little bit more verification or things like that. The optional component, and this is a hypothesis we're gonna test this, is if you're really into the Farcaster ecosystem, you just love using Farcaster apps and all these different clients, having a username that is this kind of specific to that ecosystem, which can also potentially unlock other benefits. And so one of the things is we have a decentralized storage network for all these posts. You can imagine the base level, if you have an FID, you get X amount of storage on the network. And then if you have a Farcaster username, you get more. We still need to actually kind of figure out how to like make that all work, but we have an idea on how to potentially go do that. And you can imagine some other kind of features that we could bundle in that over time. But actually its core premise, I just have this general belief that anywhere you spend a lot of time in a digital setting, you're actually willing to pay for cosmetic upgrades that kind of indicate that you're serious about status. And so give a couple of examples. So one, Fortnite, free to play game. People buy skins in that game for billions of dollars a year. Counter-Strike is another example. Doesn't actually make you a better player. Like it's just strictly a, hey, this is a little bit of flair. I think Reddit just showed an example of people are willing to buy collectibles and different things for flair. And I think that the third is, if you just kind of look at Twitter and what they're about to go through, I suspect that you're gonna see is a large number of people are gonna be willing to pay and maybe they'll have different grades of blue checks to solve for the people who want the, you know, I'm an important person. But I do think that there will be just like kind of a default where you just pay and it's like you get a little check and that's the default experience. Max me out. I want the most credit I can possibly get on Twitter. And I think that, yeah, I think you're a hundred percent right there. Right, so this is gonna be a stated preference. Oh, I don't want the check. Like this is stupid. Don't pay Elon. The reveal preferences is like, wait a second. I have a hundred thousand followers on this thing. If I don't have it, I'm gonna get knocked at the distribution. I'm gonna hold my nose, even if you don't like it and pay for it because what the deal here is, is like, if the game is everyone has a certain base level of status and that's how the default interactions are, that's the way it's gonna work. And so that's actually going directly to the protocol. It doesn't go to our company and that will go to a treasury for the protocol. And our view is over time, that should help the protocol be independent of any one company in the sense that you could imagine developers similar to Ethereum working for the protocol, probably some nonprofit. And that I think is an important thing for two reasons. So one, I think if you look at protocols like the web and email, yes, they're decentralized and it's like in theory, anyone can contribute. The reality is all the big corporations who run those big services dictate the de facto control of the networks, right? Contrast that something like Linux where it's one person, BDFL, but potentially experimenting with models there. I don't know. I think it could be pretty interesting. I think a second reason that it's useful is if people are willing to pay for something, then it's probably valuable, right? It's like by definition. And so you can imagine now if there's, I don't know, a hundred thousand, a million people who are willing to pay $10 a year to a protocol, I bet you that group of people on average is gonna be pretty high quality relative to the other social networks that exist out there. $10 is not gonna break the bank for most people. Yes, in developed countries versus developing countries is gonna have different connotations and maybe you can figure out differential pricing models or people are willing to sponsor that. But going back to the point is all you need is that FID is actually to be able to post. So it's not even like you necessarily need that. So that to me is important is actually build the muscle. Like don't pretend that you can monetize later. And I think we've seen some of this in DeFi where it's like, they're able to give tokens out, but then it's like, okay, actually, are any of these protocols gonna be able to collect fees? There's actually, I think one impressive thing about Maker is that they've actually generated revenue through stability like fees over time and from an early stage. And so I think that that's an important thing. I think I learned that at Coinbase, it's like get people to pay for things early on because that's actually gonna show you the reveal preference of consumers whether they actually value something or not. And then the second thing is on the client side, I think that there's a whole variety of options for monetization. And in our case, philosophically, just like something I'm interested in, but I also think it's the right dynamic for how I want the relationship between users and what I actually want our customers is instead of advertising, we are planning to monetize via kind of a freemium subscription model. So we will have a free tier, people can use our clients, and then we're gonna put some set of features behind a paywall. And if you're a more active and engaged user and you want these features, and hopefully we've come up with a set of features that are valuable, right? So otherwise people won't subscribe. And if they do, we shift the relationship between you being a Forecaster user and being the product, right? If you think about traditional social media, it's like time spent turns into ads watch, which turns into revenue. We can actually shift it to being a customer subscriber where our calculus changes. How do we increase time spent? Doesn't become the first thing. It's how do we provide more value to our customers and subscribers? And I think a great example of this is Amazon Prime, which started with free shipping. And then over time it got big enough that they said, hey, we're gonna add video in here because it'll make the Prime subscription more valuable. And I don't think we're adding video anytime soon. That's not the point. But the point is, is it changes the relationship between you and your users to being customers. And then I think it's your product decisions on the margin are about what's gonna actually increase something like NPS, right? So it's a customer satisfaction effectively for those who don't know what NPS is. But that is actually, I think a really powerful thing and a motive anything to be able to actually build products where people are willing to pay you for them. You actually wanna delight your users in a way that they were customers, right? I'm so programmed to say users because when you think of social media, you always say users, but if you can actually ship the customers, I think it's just a more pleasant way of, I don't know, building products. So I'm curious, my infatuation with crypto really came from this idea of having ownership in the networks that I'm building on. So, you know, being an early YouTube user or even Facebook user, building out and investing a lot of time, energy, creative heartbeats into creating a following or subscriber base there only to have that sort of removed as new monetization models or features are rolled out. It's kind of give me, I think, a very formative experience in my sort of way of looking at the world. And I think it's expanded since then. And I think there's to the point where I think like, maybe it's a bold statement, but the inequality that exists in the world right now in part, definitely in a small part is from this lack of owning the digital property that is incredibly valuable and powerful in coordinating our economy these days. So that's why Ethereum is just the most fascinating thing to me ever. That pulls through into all that we do at C-Club, the idea of community members, people contributing to the collective, having ownership or a say or governance in these things. So I'm curious how you're thinking about that. Is Farcaster going to be something that exits to community in the future? I see a few different pieces here that make that both exciting and probably fairly complicated. Yeah, the way I think about all this is I wanna prove that the hypotheses work in order before like, so just in from a sequence standpoint. So we kind of like wanted to prove first, will people even use the decentralized social protocol? We have 4,500 people using it. Metrics look good on that scale. It's a small social network today. We're gonna continue to try to grow that. So that is one that we have some early signs of like proof, but we wanna scale it a lot more. So that is still an ongoing thing. The second thing that we really wanna prove is are people willing to even pay for a username? Because we can have all these grand plans and maybe people are willing to do FIDs, which again, are one-time costs. And then most people are gonna be like, eh, no, I don't actually care about a Farcaster username or it's a very small number of people. Okay, well, so in that case, we need to actually think through is like, is there any value accrual to the protocol at all? And so you gotta actually figure out like what is the value there? There is another version, let's just hypothetically say no one wants to pay for usernames and we can't figure out anything for Farcaster the protocol to actually have a sustainable revenue. Just make that assumption. I don't believe that, but like, let's just like from an intellectual standpoint. Then we could say, okay, well, who controls the GitHub repo for the default implementation of the hub, right? Which if you think about Bitcoin, Bitcoin is technically controlled by miners, but very important to that is the like, I don't know, what is it, Bitcoin D or whatever that core piece of software that most ecosystem participants use. If that GitHub repo, which I think is like five people, it's like they need some quorum, changes the block size, like that effectively is gonna get propagated out, maybe the miners, but like, so there's a complex set of things there that play out. And so you gotta actually figure out, it's like, okay, what is the effect of the same way for this network that for example, increase the storage requirements for hubs that's gonna naturally make them more expensive, which will decrease centralization over time, which basically big companies will be able to kind of control it. How could you basically value that in terms of owning the rights to decide how that repo works? I think actually, to be totally honest, where we are today with GitHub is the primary place. It's a centralized company and it's where most people do the collaboration. And so this is actually, I'm not an investor, I just, I find it intriguing of like, can you actually move Git to a protocol that is actually very tied to like governance rights that are associated within cryptographic signatures and smart contracts and all that kind of stuff. And I think there's this company Radical that is trying to do Git that is more crypto native. I actually don't even know the latest on where they are, but you could imagine getting to a place where the commit that can actually flip that all of the core hubs that are for the most part, the practical reality is they're not gonna run their own custom, they're just gonna take whatever comes from the main repo, could actually move to a truly decentralized both data storage and control of what gets committed. So that could be interesting. And so I think that's how we wanna approach each step is have very high bar in terms of like what meets like intellectual rigor around like, is this actually worth putting a governance structure that is not gonna just be ceremonial. And so like, what I don't wanna is like announce this kind of like thing that we drew up on paper, only to then have it be like, well, practically the guy who has the GitHub key over there, regardless of what you say in this snapshot vote and on chain, like, and so that's actually one of the things I think is so interesting about nouns and I'm sure there are other, and maybe you can actually tell me about like other people doing this kind of stuff on chain, but this idea that they have an on chain treasury, there's an on chain active proposition voting governance system, and that people are building muscles, right? Because so many of these governance systems are just they don't get used enough, which means you run into this kind of like negative feedback loop that like, people are less interested or they don't.

# Sufficient Decentralization — Dan Romero [F3bbrFesZDo]_part3

delegate everything. Whereas, and maybe the nouns is too much. Like I actually, I'm not close enough to it. But I think part of it is I actually want to pay attention to what the smartest people in the space who are actively figuring this stuff out and how to coordinate these decentralized groups. Because if Farc has are successful, it has hundreds of millions, if not billions of people. And in the kind of like idealistic version of me, it's like, how amazing would it be if like, everyone could have a say in how this global internet public commons could work. I think the practical reality of it is, like the reason we have governments have elected representatives is like direct democracy. Actually, I live in California, which I think direct democracy has made some poor, short-term oriented decisions that have had long-term ramifications. But what is the right model that we can actually figure out so that these systems, to your point, where actually everyone has a say based on, you know, the value they contribute or the usage or whatever the right metric is. But also at the same time that they're effective in how they can actually be governed and make decisions, right? I think one of the challenges with like these big L1 blockchains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, and Ethereum, I think part of the story because Vitalik still exists and has I think been an important influence, it's really hard to coordinate those systems. And so I don't think like we've scratched the surface on, it's like, what is the optimal way to kind of like run these decentralized organizations, right? 100%, yeah. I think there's, I think everything moves so fast. And I think like the, what I see you rolling out and where I'd like to take this conversation is in just being very strategic in how you build value. And at C-Club, we like to talk about earning the right to do the next thing. And that's what I see you doing. And so, you know, we have a lot of folks who are community builders, right? And being strategic and tactical about building great community experiences is something that we think a lot about. And I think if we look at even just what you've shared here today, you know, you're saying Farcaster is 4,500 users. That could both seem like a lot, but I think most people would say like, that's a tiny amount of users for a social network. And maybe it has a lot more attention. People, I think that people will be shocked by it, by the number there, even though you have a great open data set that shows users and growth and activity at farcaster.network, which you can go check out. But I would love for you to sort of like help us understand either the frameworks or rule sets or strategy, which you are acting on a regular basis to build valuable experiences within Farcaster. Yeah, so I can only speak to my own experience and to the point about the size, I think about that all the time. Like if I'm on a down day, it's like startup rollercoaster, right? Down day, it's just like, how are you ever going to get to a billion people with 4,500? But then I think like last year, basically at this time, it was probably every day, fewer than 50 people using it. So from that regard, it's like, okay, like we made a decent amount of progress year over year. I also think that the other way to frame it is if the 4,500 people on Farcaster, I'm at least interacting with, you know, a thousand of them or 1,500 of them on some either lightweight way or directly. Even at Coinbase, I never hit that scale. So it's just like, this is actually the largest group of people I've ever been interacting with. And so in some ways, like it is actually a large, like if you just think of 1,500 or 4,500 people in a single room, that's a lot of people. So it depends on how negative or positive you want to be. And I try not to- For the record, I think it's, I mean, what I want to get at here is I think that's a very smart, strategic decision that you have made to go about building this network very slowly and purposefully. Yeah, I'd love for you to sort of share the thinking behind that and maybe some of the other decisions you made. Yeah, look, I think part of it is people can sense quality. I think it's like more cynical business advice assumes like, this is why I hate the term growth hacking. It's like somehow like you're manipulating people or you're figuring out like, oh, like they don't understand. And it's like, you're just the brilliant product person that's able to do it. And I think that there's maybe some truth on the margin. And definitely when you hit scale, like there's a bunch of gimmicks that you can do to juice numbers on here or there. But in terms of like trying to actually build a community, and this is actually one thing, I don't know if it was with you on Forcaster or someone who was like, oh, are you thinking about hiring a community manager? And I'm like, that's my job. Like the whole point, you know, we're a team of six. I did all the front end, but like I'm also doing the product management effectively. And like the only way to be good at product management is like actually dog food the most you possibly can of the product, right? And so like I still continue to be the most active user on the network, like by virtually any metric. Like actually starting to, there are people who are now using it more, which is always kind of wild, because I think I use it a lot. But I think it's like, am I perfect on that? No. And like, is it because my content is like amazing? It's actually just like people can tell when you put effort into things and you're being genuine and it doesn't feel like transactional of like, okay, like I did the one greeting and then I'm on to the next person. And what's challenging about that is like, it just takes time. Like it's like I spend a lot of time. Perk of having a mobile app is I can kind of do this like wherever I am, like I just hop on Forcaster. And one of the things that, for example, I follow everyone on the network. It's not gonna last forever, but by doing so I see every post. And so it's kind of like getting this global feed, but it would be really easy, for example, if I wanted to optimize for my own thing, there are plenty of people I just could unfollow. It's like, okay, I don't have to see this post anymore. But by doing two things, one, it kind of actually forces me to engage with people who if I was like playing Twitter, which is like, I've never run Twitter. So like I try to optimize Twitter for my own benefit. I could easily ignore someone. Whereas now I try to actually engage with someone. Even if maybe I'm like, oh, this post is like a little lower quality or it feels a little shilly, what can I do to actually bring the best out of this conversation? And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And I think that the second thing that Varun and I both try to follow everyone is we basically kind of see where the network is going to be into the future almost, because most people don't follow that many people. And so their experience might be delightful today because they're only following people under the network who know the norms. By the way, every community starts to develop norms. And that's actually one of the biggest things that I've noticed. Like as we've added a lot more people recently, the marginal person listens a little less and they do a little bit more talking because they're kind of bringing Twitter culture in. Whereas I think what makes Farcaster great is like, you know, the classic, what people call engagement farming on Farcaster is people try to ask a thoughtful question and then they get a whole bunch of thoughtful answers. Or it's like the person comes in and they try to do a thread. And it's like, we actually made the UI not work with threads because we're trying to nudge people into like, hey, it's a slightly different modality. But I think with seeing kind of like what the average new user, how they're behaving on the network. And it's a little easier to do this in a public social network with a feed versus like a discord with a bunch of different channels and private conversations that you can't see what are happening. We can be like, huh, interesting. The average person is coming in now and is starting to do a little bit more of like the broadcast rather than engage. What can we do from a product standpoint? And that's the perk of like the community building post product is we can change some of the defaults so that it kind of can nudge things in a different way. And so like one example of this is we haven't had an algo in the app until recently and it's the second tab. It's not the default tab partially because I like the like promise that if I'm following you I get that. But the highlights tab is basically all engaged towards conversations. We actually don't put a lot of weight on likes and recasts which I think on Twitter that I don't know the exact algo but that seems to be more important. And the reason is those questions to me bring the and kind of engagements that actually brings out the best of Forecaster because you actually see a variety of different opinions and people try to give thoughtful answers. And so like, that's a great example of we were organically trying to do that before that tab existed, but by adding that in and showing that as like kind of in the default UI you're slowly nudging the community towards a set of norms that hopefully like whatever set of norms you have that's what actually compounds, right? And so I think that's something and it's one of the things that we're thinking about is scaling is like, we're really, we keep saying this like we wanna scale with quality. We don't wanna grow too fast because then the percentage of the network that's new to the network that doesn't know the norms starts to shift the culture versus if you keep it consistent where you're growing consistently, but not too much the network can almost absorb new people in and kind of teach them the culture. And I think the analogy that I've used in multiple regards and it's not perfect, but if you think of like our client for Forecaster, so Forecaster is kind of like a country. Our client is like New York City and Ellis Island or in the 20th century where most immigrants to the US came in. You had a ton of people stay in that general area and in the East coast, still the most populous densely populated area of the country, right? All different cultures, all different places people are from. But there are plenty of people who moved on from that area and they moved to different States and brought different cultures with them and subgroups and et cetera. But I think that the important thing is like, one, we set the tone when people arrive. And then two, like when you show up to a new country, there are customs and cultures that you, and a particularly a country like the US where they kind of become absorbed, especially into that next generation of people who are here. But it's not like you lose the culture from the country that you came. And so I think that like, it's not a concrete thing, but it's something that I think a lot about, especially because our product feels so much like Twitter, that people, they're gonna behave similar to what the UI shows them. And so that I think is another thing that we think a lot about in terms of the community. Well, I mean, so my moment of like maximum value from Forecaster came when I asked a question, struggling with my calendar, feeling very overwhelmed with the number of meetings that exist and in no world would I post this to Twitter and the density of useful folks who would give me useful information there would just be very low. I think, you know, there's, if I think of like who else has a crazy schedule, it's actually people who are building in crypto and who are doing that at a fairly high level. And actually they're all on Forecaster. Of course, I posted that to Forecaster, how do you manage your Cal time? And it's, you know, in the Twitter sense, it got the most recasts and likes and watches out of everything I've done, but the value was not in that. And that's not what I was searching for there. The value was that the incredible responses from people who I know have gone through the same sort of phase that I'm in right now. And, you know, there's, I mean, it was overwhelming the amount of useful ideas and suggestions that came back. So, I mean, and to see that being prioritized, I think makes a ton of sense. I think also from sort of the outside, there's just very simple things that you do that I think really set this product up for success. One is I think the slow growth, right? So it's not just anybody who can show up there. And I think that curation in an early community has like an important role to play. Not to say that we should all have walled gardens or these gatekeepers, but I think, you know, it's a very smart early decision. Two, yeah, you follow everybody, which like means that when you show up, somebody is greeting you, right? You're walking into the door. You were very generous with your recasts and a lot of people follow you. And so there's sort of like this immediate boost that comes when, and I have the sense that you are doing that in a way that is also sort of nudging people towards the better use of this tool rather than just, so there's like a big social dynamic that exists there, much in the same way where, you know, somebody says thanks to you in a team and if you're working in an office and another sort of culture that gets built there. I think that those three things, even though they're just probably the simplest things that you could just sort of throw away, like as maybe givens, they're just not givens. And I know I struggle with that even thinking about participating in the C-Club Discord on a regular basis, given where my attention is. And I can justify my maybe lack of engagement there as it not being our core community, but very much need to, you know, continue to show up in the way that we want others to show up in our communities. So, and I think you do a great job of that. We are coming up on time here. So I have two things. One, I asked the Forecaster community what questions we should ask you, and we actually touched on many of them. So I want to, you know, shout out Les and Karthik and Ivy, who actually asked her question, and Cyrus and MK for all asking those questions. And I think we got to them in indirect ways, but Ivy, we did not touch on this question. And so I'm going to, maybe we can wrap up with this one. At heart, are you a shape rotator or a word cell? Well, I was an English major in college, so I think it's going to be hard to call me a shape rotator. I think I'm not one to love just like very- Oh, come on. Come on, it's AB. No, no, I'm team word cell, how about that? But I think that there's value in learning from both. And I don't know, he's a controversial person, obviously, but Elon is a good example of, is like definitely a shape rotator, but the reason he has 110 million followers ain't the shape rotating as much as the word selling. So, yeah. Yeah, I love it. I also hate the binary in many ways, but awesome. All right, so my last question for you, I think there's gonna be a lot of people who want to get into Forecaster after listening to this absolute brilliant conversation with you. Can we make five invites available to people? Is that a game you play? We can make more than five invites available. You DM me on Twitter, DWR, ironic, yes, that way to get onto the decentralized social network is DM me on the centralized, but it's actually useful because here's actually what I'm gonna value. So if you have mutuals who are already on there, I've followed now 2,500 people on Twitter, way more than I ever have. And so if people who are on Forecaster I'm following follow you, that's a sign. It bumps it right up to the top of like people I respond to. And if you don't have those mutuals, this is a kind of a newer process. Send me something that you've built, put out into the world. So wrote, art, whatever, show me something that you've actually created. Because I think one thing that has worked really well is that Forecaster has really resonated with people who there's a sense of agency and that they can do something. And it doesn't have to be just code, right? Like you don't have to send me your GitHub, like you can do that. But it's just something that they want to express themselves in a way that is like putting themselves out there. And I think that so far the community is pretty welcoming to that, right? Whether you're doing digital art or writing or screenshot essays or code. And so that would be the thing that's gonna distinguish. I do get a lot of spam on my Twitter DMs now, but I think that one of those things, I go through every single one of them. And especially if you mentioned that you heard it on this podcast, which I've now given this long spiel, like you probably will- C club sent you here. Those are the lines, C club sent me here along with something cool that you've actually done. I love that description of folks with agency. And it's definitely the part of the Twitter world that I love the most is just that most of my active interactions there with those folks. It's a privilege to be able to interact with people both through this podcast and through our community who very much have that as well. I think web three, crypto, whatever we want to call it, I think in at least the pockets of the world that I live in there are so dense with those types of human beings. And it manages to make life a heck of a lot more fun. I would agree. Hey, thanks for having me. Danny, I really appreciate your time, man. And for those listening, shoot down a message, go check out Farcaster and you can give me a follow there too, because I hang out there more often than I probably care to admit, Dan and I were talking about earlier. Apparently there are people who take time off over the holidays to not be on the internet. And I was saying how I don't- I won't be taking time off over the holidays. But so, yeah, me. Yeah, cheers. Love it. Hello, friends, Steph here, media team steward at C club. If you liked this episode, please subscribe, rate and review Building at the Edges.

# Sufficiently Decentralized Social Media w⧸Dan Romero ｜ S4 E8 [tUceJ4n2UIw]_part1

Welcome to Rehash. Hey, everybody, welcome back to Rehash, a Web3 podcast. I'm your host, Diana Chen. And today we're speaking with Dan Romero, founder of Farcaster and Warpcast, all about decentralized social media and everything Dan is doing and building toward a more decentralized future. Dan was nominated by Triumph and voted onto the podcast by Madrash, Adam Levy, Tim Black, Scott Moore, Meg Lister, Triumph and an anonymous voter. Before we dive into our conversation, here's a quick word from the Web3 projects that helped make this season possible. Social media wasn't designed for ads and algorithms. It was made for people. And at Lens Protocol, we're putting people back in control. We're not looking for users' data. We're here to build a community of collaborators, builders, artists and dreamers ready to unlock a new world of social media. This isn't just an app. It's a flourishing ecosystem of platforms and experiences owned and operated by the developers and creators who are bringing it to life. In the Lensverse, you don't just own your content. You own everything. Your data, your connections, the value you bring to the table, it all stays in your possession exactly where it should be. As a creator, the Lens ecosystem offers a new set of tools for connecting with your audience. Your data is truly portable and belongs to you. Collect once and distribute everywhere in the Lensverse. You can even take your followers with you from app to app. As a developer, you can skip right past building the base layers and scaling your users by plugging your new app directly into Lens's existing infrastructure and community. So whether you create with a brush or a camera, sound waves or lines of code, it's time you got your due. Come create the future of social media with us on Lens Protocol. This is the last social media handle you'll ever need. Have you seen how epic Ambuyer Wallet is? How epic it is? Yeah. Cue the music. Ambuyer is a Web3 wallet that makes crypto self-custody easy and secure for everyone. Instead of relying on clunky seed phrases, you can create an account with the hardware wallet or username and password, secure it with two-factor authentication, and regain access with Ambuyer's cloud recovery. Need to pay out some contributors or execute a bunch of trades? No problem, chief. Cue up as many transactions as you want, and when you're ready, execute the entire batch at the same time, paying gas only once. You can even prepay for gas with stablecoins or Ambuyer's native wallet token, which will get you some cash back. Without ever leaving the Ambuyer interface, you can manage assets from over a dozen chains, safely migrate them with Ambuyer's built-in bridge, and seamlessly interact with apps like Uniswap, Aave, and Snapshot, all within the same transaction. Plus, Ambuyer is constantly growing their dApp catalog with trusted partners and collaborating with builders who want to establish the new standard for smart contract wallets. So pretty epic, huh? Yeah, I already know all that, though. I've had an Ambuyer wallet for months. And you didn't tell me? You never asked. To get involved and truly own your assets, go to ambuyer.com. How was your day? Bad. What happened? I bought some NFTs, and then they just disappeared. Sounds like your NFT creator should have used NFT.storage. NFT.what? NFT.storage! Come on, I'll show you! With NFT.storage, anyone can easily upload their NFT data to a decentralized and reliable storage network, completely for free! Wow! How does it work? Well… Instead of relying on centralized and impermanent storage solutions, NFT.storage uploads your files to IPFS and Filecoin. These are powerful peer-to-peer networks that are made for the decentralized web. Thanks to IPFS's unique storage system, you can be confident that once your files are uploaded, they'll be accessible from anywhere in the world for as long as you'd like. They're already trusted by some of the biggest names in Web3, like OpenSea, Magic Eden, and Rarible. By adding files to these networks for free, NFT.storage is helping to turn proper NFT data management into a public good. This will ensure that NFTs will remain accessible and secure in the long run, so you won't get rugged again. Gee, so I just upload my files and NFT.storage will take care of the rest? Now you're getting it! Go to NFT.storage today to upload some NFT data of your own, for free. And be sure to follow NFT.storage on Twitter at NFTDOTStorage. So without further ado, here is our guest, Dan Romero. Welcome to the podcast, Dan. How are you doing today? Thanks for having me. I'm doing well. Awesome. So you are one of the biggest names in decentralized social, when people think about that, they immediately think about you and they think about Farcaster and Warpcast now. But before we get into all of that, I kind of just want to pick your brain a little bit about decentralized social, about how we even got to this place that we're at now, having all of these things that we don't like about Web2 social and trying to build something better. So take us back all the way to the beginning. How did we get here to this very centralized ad-driven social media model where users are the product instead of the product being the product? So I think it's helpful to just go back to the beginning of the web, so Web1, and to think about that a lot of what was being built was being built on top of open protocols, specifically, you know, HTTP and the web. So you have Netscape, web browsers, and then all the kind of like first Web10, dotcom boom websites, right? So completely permissionless platform, you register domain, you can build whatever you want on that domain. So whether that's eBay or Amazon, it can be, you know, on the e-commerce side, but you could also put up a blog or whatever you want to do. Email is another example from that era, right? So everyone can go sign up again with a domain and you can get an email address. And for the average consumer, they ended up doing that through Gmail or Hotmail, but ultimately all email is built on top of a credibly neutral protocol called SMTP. Web2 comes along in the kind of like early aughts. And what it does really well is it increases the total number of people who are actually publishing stuff online, right? Like UGC was the term, user-generated content. And so you had all these new apps and services and then mobile made it even easier where someone who during the Web1 era, if they had to register domain and get a web host in order to put up a website, now you can just kind of go and sign up for Tumblr or, you know, Twitter and then you could actually start kind of posting pretty easily and get your message out there. So you had a massive increase in the total amount of people using the internet for publishing and user-generated content. But as a result, you had a lot of these networks get really, really large and they develop network effects and they were able to start kind of changing the kind of rules is the wrong term, but just kind of changing how they operated. So a good example, Twitter. Twitter in the early days was actually a very developer-friendly platform. They had like a very open API. Most of the early mobile apps for Twitter were actually built by third-party developers. And then around 2014, 2015, Twitter, thinking about going public, decided that, hey, we're actually going to severely limit what can be done via the API and kind of forced everyone on to the kind of default Twitter-owned Twitter client because that was better for monetization. And so I think that across the board with Web 2, you started kind of with this, still the idealistic vision of Web 1 and with this kind of convenience, ease of use. But fast forward to kind of 2020, all of these networks were kind of out of scale. And within a 10-year period, we went from people joking about like, why would you use Twitter? Like, no one cares about what you're having for lunch to Twitter is an existential threat to democracy. It needs to be regulated, dragging these people in front of Congress. And so I think the challenge for where we are now, and the term Web 3 is always gets people really upset, it feels like, because everyone has a different definition for it. But what I think is the opportunity for Web 3 right now is you can take the foundation of Web 1, which are these open protocols, and the ease of use and convenience that kind of Web 2 pioneered, especially on mobile, and can you kind of bring those two back together in some sort of harmony, where you have the kind of ownership and freedom and choice that Web 1 provides with that kind of what we've come to expect, like really high quality user experience of Web 2. That's kind of the dream for, I would say, Web 3 social. And there are a bunch of different ways of approaching that, Forecaster is one of those. Would you say that the original intentions of Web 1 are very similar to the intentions we have now with what we're trying to build with Web 3? I think intentions is always a little hard because, you know, A, it's historical, so hard to know what people are thinking exactly at the time outside of asking someone, right? Maybe Marc Andreessen could have told you what he was thinking in 1993 when he was working on Mosaic, which eventually became Netscape. I think the way these neutral protocols work in practice is actually the thing that I'm most excited about from where we can take things with a decentralized social networking protocol because we know what permissionless innovation did for the web, right? Like Airbnb didn't have to get approval to launch Airbnb, right? Whereas if you think about like the paradigm that we live under in the mobile ecosystem today, Apple can decide whether an app can exist or not, right? And so we see a lot of this today with crypto apps on the iPhone, you know, really restrictive rules around NFTs, like you can't even link to OpenSea. And so I think what I would like to kind of see is the world shift back a little bit more towards just how things operated with the web and frankly continue to operate with the web today, but have that both expand at the kind of like application development layer. So having that exist on the mobile platforms, which that's not even a Web 3 thing, that's maybe some policy change at the federal government level. But then as it relates to social networks, figuring out a way to take these kind of network effects that exist in these siloed centralized companies and move them more towards a protocol, which is credibly neutral. And that as a kind of user, I have the freedom to move between different applications and not have to worry about my audience being locked into one silo. And then as a developer, if I choose to build an application, the relationship I have with my application is between me and my users, not like some third party that can kind of revoke access. You know, we just saw this with Twitter, right? So I had mentioned before, there was a vibrant third party ecosystem in the early 2010s for Twitter. They kind of hamstrung that starting in 2014, 2015. But then there were still apps that existed for almost a decade, even in that hamstrung state that a couple of weeks ago, new ownership of Twitter, they decided that API is no longer a priority and they just got cut off. And so if you actually build a protocol based social network, that should never be able to happen. And I think that that's a big aspiration for where we're headed. Okay, so I want to dissect that a little bit. And you've already started getting into this. But just to take a step back, if you were to dissect the Twitter product bundle as it stands today, what are the primary elements that you would find there? And then I would love if you could also sort of compare and contrast that to a decentralized social product bundle and the elements that you would expect to find there. So I think that the core feature of Twitter is distribution. When it tells you anything otherwise, like, oh, it's a social network. The reality is, if I have a message that I want to get out into the world, and I have an audience, the best place in the world to do that is on Twitter, right? It's very simple. You can do it right on your phone. There's no video pre-production or all the stuff that's overhead of something like YouTube, or even TikTok. Maybe Instagram with just like being able to snap a photo is basically as easy. But those are the kind of two platforms where I think is like anyone who just has an audience can get a message out to that audience as fast as possible. And I think Twitter, that's the kind of core thing it provides. It wasn't necessarily that at the beginning, but that's what it's kind of evolved into. So the idea that if I have a large audience, I can get it instantly distributed to that audience on their phones in a real-time manner, that's the core of what Twitter provides. That said, there's a bunch of other things bundled with that. So there's an identity system, right? Your username on Twitter belongs to Twitter. You might build a lot of affinity around that name, and people might refer to you by your kind of Twitter handle. Like obviously on TV, they always kind of have it, but that can be taken away at any point. Another thing that Twitter is obviously providing you, especially in a world where there aren't third-party clients, is that they provide you with your feed. So as a user consuming content on Twitter, they kind of dictate what you're going to see in addition to any of the moderation decisions that they make. And the other point being is that hosting of the actual content exists on Twitter servers. So all of that kind of comes down to is you have to use Twitter and their terms of service and their set of rules if you want to access the distribution of Twitter. And contrast that to something like email, where if I have an email newsletter, let's say I have 100,000 subscribers for my email newsletter, I don't have to use any one email provider, right? I can actually shift between MailChimp and Substack pretty seamlessly, especially if you have your own domain, because then the end user doesn't even know you're sending it from a different service. It's kind of this plumbing in the background. That doesn't exist for Web2Social, right? So if you want to access the Twitter distribution that you've built, you have to use Twitter, and Twitter can decide if you have access to that distribution. Autowim can remove you. There's no recourse. You can't go argue in court, hey, I deserve my Twitter account back. YouTube, same thing. Instagram, the same thing. And so I think that that bundle is unfortunate in that if you can separate out the different elements and you as both the kind of like publisher or creator, you know, trying to speak to your audience, and or the user have the ability to choose different tools, whether it's like, okay, if I'm actually using Twitter for kind of like work, I might want to use a more power user tool that has all these bells and whistle features and analytics, whereas an average user, maybe I'm just consuming, I probably want something that's a little simpler, maybe more algorithmic. And so the ability to get to a world where you're not forced to use any one solution, and you can easily change between different applications based on the use case and kind of like what you're hoping to accomplish, that's what we're trying to achieve with Farkaster and fundamentally something different than Twitter, which to be fair to Twitter, in the early days of Twitter was actually very close to that, right? It was a centralized company. And Paul Graham actually has a great essay, 2009. You just Google Paul Graham Twitter, and it's very short, but he specifically talks about how Twitter is kind of, it should be a protocol, but somehow it ended up within a company. And in that early era, it felt like more like a protocol because of the open APIs, because of the fact that they were encouraging people to kind of experiment and innovate with the access to the data. But 10 years later, we're in a very, very different place. You raise a good point. I think that's something that actually a lot of people still struggle to understand is the difference between a protocol and an app. So Twitter as it stands today as an app, Farkaster is a decentralized social protocol, and then Warpcast is this like Twitter-like app that is built on top of the Farkaster protocol. Correct? Yeah. We just recently rebranded. So I think when we originally started out, my co-founder and I, we kind of wanted to just keep things simple. So Farkaster was the protocol and the app that you were using because no one else was built interested in building anything on top of Farkaster, the protocol. So it was actually pretty easy. It was just like, oh, download Farkaster and you can also use the protocol. We're now at a place where there are actually multiple teams and individuals building within the Farkaster ecosystem. And so they have different names for their apps. And we felt like it was the best long-term decision for the protocol to actually separate the name of the app that our team is building. And so we renamed it from Farkaster. So you can almost say it was like the official Farkaster app to Warpcast. And the analogy I always use is if you think about email, there is no official email app. Most people use Gmail, at least in the US. But I think that that's kind of clear to people that email and Gmail are two different things. And then within Ethereum, the basic example here is there's Ethereum and then there's Metamask. It's not like the official Ethereum wallet, even though Metamask kind of is tied in with consensus, which was kind of in the early days of Ethereum pretty involved. And so in our case, Farkaster, Warpcast, it'll continue to be painful for a while, especially for people who kind of like first onboarded where they like thought Farkaster, Farkaster. But I think in the long run, it'll just create a healthier ecosystem for the protocol that the protocol is this neutral thing. And you're one of many apps built on top of it. Yeah, I totally agree. I want to go back to the beginning days of Farkaster. You actually first had the idea for Farkaster as this RSS plus is what you called it. And you've got an article about this up on your website that people can go and read. But I would love to hear you talk about that original idea, how that came about and how it has shifted over time and morphed into what is today Farkaster. So I've been a big user of RSS and Twitter for 15 plus years. And when Google shut down Google Reader, for those on the audience who don't know what Google Reader was. So RSS is a protocol. It's very simple. It allows you, whether it's a blog or even today, podcasts are actually powered by RSS just to kind of syndicate out content over the internet. And you can kind of consume an RSS feed and then show it in any UI you want. In the early 2010s, there was a product from Google called Google Reader. And it was incredibly popular. It was actually almost too popular because they didn't charge any money for it. So it made the market for like kind of like premium RSS readers hard to monetize because Google was giving something away for free. But I think the kind of like flaw in RSS at the time, it was like pretty competitive with Twitter in terms of like the way you consume news or information, is that RSS is not as well suited or at least how RSS readers were designed to mobile. And so Twitter, and especially kind of that third party ecosystem of third party apps for Twitter, kind of really pioneered this like core like mobile UX of the feed. And in doing so, I think outcompeted RSS at that time for kind of being the primary way to if you're like kind of an info vore or just really want to know what's happening in the world, better to use a Twitter feed with, you know, and they didn't even really have an algo at that point, but, you know, Twitter feed with like the retweets and, you know, following a diverse set of sources than using kind of like an RSS reader. And so over the last 10 years, RSS has effectively withered away. It still has plenty of like power user folks who are using it, but like compared to the number of people who are using something like Twitter, you know, it's pretty minuscule. But what's powerful about RSS is it's a permissionless protocol, right? So if I put up an RSS feed on my website, I have one on my blog, anyone can use that as a standard kind of API for consuming content that is like newly posted to the blog and then can do whatever they want with it, right? There's no API key required. It's kind of this public standardized format. And so I think what we, you know, Verun and I having both worked at Coinbase for five years saw the power of permissionless protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

# Sufficiently Decentralized Social Media w⧸Dan Romero ｜ S4 E8 [tUceJ4n2UIw]_part2

within crypto and kind of said, well, what can we do to improve the kind of like mobile experience for a permissionless protocol like RSS? And so that kind of made us do two things. So the first is we actually built the initial client for Forecaster because our point of view is we could come up with like the most brilliant technical spec in the world, but if you didn't have someone actually building it like an actual app with users on top of it, it's kind of like a science experiment. It's like, who cares? And so we actually started by wanting to build like, okay, how can we actually build like a consumer app that is as easy to use as Twitter? And so Warpcast is now what we call that. It's pretty close. I don't say it's 100% as good as Twitter, but we've made a lot of progress over the last couple of years. And then the second thing is, how can you build a kind of protocol that has the best features of RSS, right? The simplicity, the permissionlessness with the best kind of UX and features of Twitter, which is the kind of like instant real-time feedback, right? So really basic example. If I use RSS today and someone reads my blog post, there basically is no indication that you read that post, right? Like someone would have to send me an email and say, I really liked your blog post. Whereas if I post something on Twitter, put view counts to the side for a second. Just the fact that people can instantly reply while they're reading what is being said in addition to the ability to like or retweet, that's pretty powerful. And so bringing those kind of like standard interactions from kind of like someone consuming content and kind of coupling that together, I think is really important, but doing so in a decentralized way that allows you to kind of accomplish the permissionlessness of RSS. And so it's like, take the interactivity and speed of Twitter mixed with the kind of like simplicity and permissionlessness of RSS. And that's basically Farcaster. Gotcha. You just reminded me of an article talking about your co-founder Varun that he wrote about sufficient decentralization as applied to social networks. And it's this idea that, you know, maybe what we're going after isn't full decentralization. Maybe that isn't the answer to all of our problems, but what we should be focused on instead is sufficient decentralization. In your mind, like what is the difference between the two as applied to this decentralized social context? I just love to hear your thoughts on that. Yeah. So one way to think about it is you have centralized social networks, what we kind of have today, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and then you have kind of like maximally decentralized social networks where it's like everyone's running their own server and you are kind of king of your own castle with that. And you can kind of like iterate with everything else. And then between those two points of the spectrum, you reach some level of more centralized or more decentralized. And so our point of view is if you actually start with centralized, because that's the thing that's won from a total number of people using it and user experience standpoint, and work your way towards decentralization, at some point you reach what we would say it's more art than science, but it's kind of a sufficient decentralization for the design of your social network where you can optimize for certain things being decentralized and other ones you don't necessarily care as the average user, or even as a developer or kind of like a big creator with a large audience. And so I think it's always useful to use analogies from other protocols. Email is a great example of this. The average person uses email in an extremely centralized way. They use a Gmail account. They don't even own their own name, right? Like if you have whatever email at Gmail, Google can take that away at any point. It's actually kind of scary to think about like if your entire life is around a Gmail account and you got shut off from Google for whatever reason, there is no recourse again for you to be able to go to court and say, hey, I need access to that email. Like my financial accounts and everything are tied there. Whereas if you had your own domain and you're using G Suite and Google decided to kick you off, you could actually just then change your DNS records and switch over to FastMail or Microsoft Outlook or whatever other provider in the email world. And in the same example, by the way, a sub-stack MailChimp, right? Like if I have an email newsletter, I can easily change different providers. And so I think what we wanted to kind of make a bet on is the average user is going to use a massively large central at scale, simple, easy to use service that plugs into a wider ecosystem of a bunch of different other providers and varying degrees of do-it-yourself or kind of other competing centralized providers. And the thing that we wanted to make sure that was decentralized is the actual identifier, right? The way to find you on the network, in this case, the username, is the thing that you actually want to be able to have be completely portable, right? And if that is tied to where you sign up, it actually, I think, gets really tricky because if I use a domain name based system and someone else owns the domain name, like the Gmail example, yeah, it's a decentralized or kind of like network that you can use different providers. But if your identity is actually tied up with that provider, the likelihood of you being able to move to a different service is pretty low. And so they actually have a lot more power over you. And I think that that is something that I learned at Coinbase where one thing that's really powerful, Coinbase lives in an environment where at any point, a customer of Coinbase can take their Bitcoin or Ethereum and move it either to their own wallet or to a competitor within a few clicks. And there is no, oh, well, this is special Coinbase Bitcoin or special Coinbase Ethereum. Like, no, it's completely fungible and you can move it to a different provider. And so by virtue of having to live on a network where there is actually full interoperability between other alternatives, Coinbase is forced to earn their customers trust on an ongoing basis, not because they have some like monopoly in terms of like a network effect or thing like that. Whereas if I don't like what Instagram is doing with their client, right? So there was a big kind of recent blow up where Instagram is moving away from photos in the feed to doing more video. Tough, like Instagram's like you want access to the Instagram graph and app, we get to decide. And there is no other option. I think there was even an app that launched, it's like Instagram OG or something where you could just get photos and it got shut down. And so I think where we're hoping to get to is by making the identity something that you can actually move around the ecosystem pretty easy, you've kind of reached the sufficient decentralization where you could still be using any of these large centralized providers, but your ability to kind of like switch to a different provider and seamlessly continue to communicate with your audience. That's for us, the thing that you actually really need to nail from a decentralization standpoint. And then arguably, for the average person, the rest of it, you want to centralize as possible because usually the centralization means you get better UX, right? But actually still having the ability, the credible ability to exit and then still interoperate with the rest of the ecosystem is the kind of thing that makes the protocol valuable. So basically, you want to have, for instance, like whatever my handle is on Twitter, DDW Chen, I want to be able to carry that handle and all of the followers I have on Twitter across all different social platforms. So it would be nice if I just started a YouTube channel for the first time, if I could expose all of my Twitter followers that I had spent the last decade building up to my new YouTube channel or to my new sub stack or to my new Instagram or TikTok or whatever other social. Totally. And you can kind of do this today in the sense that if you have a big audience on Twitter and you start a new YouTube, you just post a link to your YouTube and you slowly recreate. Now, in a world where the kind of like underlying social layer is a protocol, whether it's Forecaster or something different, then the idea would be you try a new app or service, and the developer there actually can just kind of permissionlessly pull in all of your other activity and offer you a better first run experience. So I would imagine that that probably increases the likelihood that people stick around in a new app. So it actually benefits the creation of new apps because that kind of like cold start bootstrapping problem is a little bit easier. It's still not quite solved, right? Like just because you can like interoperate with a bunch of data doesn't mean that you're going to stick around with a new app. But every bit of friction you can remove for someone to attempt a new type of app that has a social component to it, I think is an improvement. And in the aggregate, you end up having that much more innovation and attempts at new apps and services. So, for instance, my handle on Warpcast right now, which I believe is Tree Girl, I actually had to change it because I lost my keys to the first one, is going to be the same one when somebody else comes on a Forecaster and builds a new app, maybe like a photo sharing app, or maybe a video app or whatever, and I sign up for that app, then the people who are following me on Warpcast right now will automatically be following me on those new apps as well. Yeah, if the developer chooses that as the experience, right? They might just say, hey, like we have an algorithmic feed, and we're going to use all of your previous casts and likes into our algo to figure out like who you might be interested in. So, I think each developer is going to be able to have the freedom to choose what signals they want to use. But I think from a kind of like simplicity for the user, once I have a Forecaster account, right, like if you think about it, it's decentralized, I can just now use that as the kind of like way I sign up or sign into any of these other apps. But the important thing is, it's not like it's a single company that's administering the, you know, sign in with Facebook or Twitter is a centralized thing, right? So, if you lose access to your Twitter account, then you can't use that anywhere else. Whereas sign in with Forecaster, because it's the identity component is rooted in Ethereum address, means that when I sign up for that new video app, whatever it is, the relationship is between myself and that app, not Warpcast or any of the other apps that I might have started with. And so, that sovereign relationship between the developer and the user is actually pretty important, because that encourages developers to take the additional amount of effort, right? Like building anything is really hard. But building something and then thinking that you could have the terms of service or the rug pulled out from underneath you, because you know, you're growing really fast and like, they ultimately have the keys to the identity that just like it may have worked 15 years ago when we were first starting out a web too, but I think developers are pretty sophisticated today. And they don't want to be dependent on some third party platform that can change the rules on them really fast. Yeah, for sure. One common question I hear a lot from people is, what is the definition difference between Farcaster and Lens or other similar ones, Mastodon, Blue Sky, similarly trying to build these decentralized social protocols? Can you explain from your point of view, like what the major differences are? And maybe they are as similar as people think. But if there are any important differences, could you just clarify that for listeners? Yeah, look, there are a bunch of different people building different implementations of decentralized social protocols. I'm generally of the mind that there's not going to kind of just be one in the same way that you just don't have one blockchain, right? Like you've Bitcoin, you have Ethereum, you have a bunch of other ones. You know, there isn't one browser. There's like, you know, well, browser is actually an interesting example, because the web, HTTP did consolidate around kind of like one single protocol, and email being another. But I think the kind of like contrast, though, is in web two, right, the social networks, we don't have just one social network. It's not like everyone just uses Facebook. And if Facebook hadn't acquired Instagram, arguably, like it would even be less relevant today. And so the social network market, despite having a couple of really, really large ones, is relatively dynamic, right? Like TikTok didn't exist a few years ago. Twitter, Pinterest, like there's actually a lot of pretty at scale social networks relative to those kind of like web one protocols. And so hard to know, like how things play out in the sense that does it look more like web two, or you have multiple? Or does it look more like web one, where you only have, you know, kind of like one or two standard? I'll leave that to an armchair pundit to try to figure out. But in terms of like, how is Farcaster different? I'd say that there's like two primary buckets that differentiates how Farcaster is approaching building its protocol relative to maybe some others. So the first is, this is more for the kind of crypto decentralized social protocols. We have a minimal on chain footprint. So our point of view is blockchains are great. They are expensive, slow computers that are really good at preventing double spends. Now, are they going to get faster and cheaper over time? Yeah, that's fine. But I think as it relates to building something today, our point of view was, if we're going to use a blockchain, like, let's actually minimize how much we're using, because the goal here is actually to build a social network that people, the average everyday people can use over the next few years. And so our point of view is the thing that the blockchain solves for Farcaster, and the reason to actually deal with the cost and the complexity of doing that, is that sufficient decentralization of the identity. And our point of view is the moment you start relying on some type of corporation to manage the identity system, consortium to manage it, make the assumption that users are going to sign up and get a domain on their own. I don't believe that. Like, 30 years of history, people don't buy their own domain names. It's a very, very power user thing. And so from our standpoint, what we wanted to do is make it so that when you sign up on Farcaster, we abstract away the complexity enough that you're going to get a username that feels more like a Web2 username, right? Just like when you sign up for Twitter or Instagram, you get that username. And the complexity of managing that is just is just managed away. And in doing so, I think that that improves the usability, right? Like, we're not using the chain for all these posts, right? Compared to maybe some others that put everything on chain. And then the identity system relative to, and this is the second camp, the federated model, which says, I have a server, I'm associating my identity with this server and or this domain. I think that's just, from our standpoint, it's too power user, right? Like, users don't want to think about servers. They don't want to think about, like, which handle and the domain that's associated with. It's actually kind of confusing because now you have, like, email is a good example. This email today would just never exist. It would be an app username system because, like, that's the simpler version. Email was kind of like a power user, early, like, 80s internet version of an identity system that is kind of just stuck around. But if you look at how most mobile apps authenticate, they use a phone number, right? Because it's a simpler experience for users. And none of the kind of, like, Web 2 social networks adopted this kind of, like, multi-name system. It's just, like, a single username. And so you kind of solve for two things is you don't have the complexity of having to do everything on chain. And then as it relates to the kind of federated model, you don't have this identity that is kind of tied to a server. And I know there are some attempts at potentially trying to make the identity not associated with a single server in kind of the federated model of things. But that's still TBD. And the more I hear about that, the more I'm saying, hmm, it sounds like you're more and more wanting this neutral place to store the username data that can't be mucked with by any individual company or country. Sounds like a good use for a blockchain. I think where we're going to get to is that's either going to work or it's not. And we'll find out from the market standpoint. I think that the third thing that relates to especially the federated systems is the developer experience for building a new app is actually much harder in a federated system. Because if you think about it, something like Mastodon, how many Mastodon servers are there in the world? A thousand? Okay, scale it up. Ten thousand, a hundred thousand. If you want to go build a new Mastodon client, in order to actually provide a good user experience that's on par with Web2, you now have to interface and index data from all of those different servers. There's going to be weird quirks. The idea of getting to global state for the network to answer the question of what's happening, right? That's the kind of like primary thing that Twitter does really well, is a lot of work for a developer. Whereas, contrast that with a blockchain, yes, you have to put a bunch of stuff on chain and pay, which that has its own set of challenges. The beauty of a blockchain is you do get to global state every time that there's a block confirmation, right? So it's actually a decent developer experience. And so what we've done with Farcaster, we've tried to say, well, if we can avoid the cost of doing stuff on chain, but also have a single kind of global state that like gets to consensus really fast, that's actually going to be a great developer experience. And so we've actually done that with hubs, which are kind of just rolling out now. So it took us a couple of years to figure this out, where a hub is kind of like an Ethereum node, but for the Farcaster network, all of the data is stored off chain, right? So there's no cost from a kind of like per transaction. The identity is pulled from the Ethereum blockchain, and all of these hubs are able to sync the entire global state of the network in a pretty short period of time. So as a developer, all I have to do is spin up a new hub in the same way that if I want to build on Ethereum, I just spin up an Ethereum node or use Alchemy or something like that. And then I'm off to the races. Like I can be like, okay, do I want to see Tree Girls, CAS, boom. Like that's one API request. Like there is no, oh, what server is she on? Or like, how do I know where are the likes going to each one of her posts? Like where did they come from? Did I actually get to that kind of global state? This just exists in a single server, and that's going to be open source. And so we've spent a lot of time working on that. And our point of view is the identity system that is sufficiently decentralized mixed with this kind of like great developer experience that powers the underlying network is the optimal model to do. And we'll see. I mean, it's going to take us probably a few months or years to figure out which of any of these decentralized social networks will work. And then maybe the reveal preference three years from now is that people don't actually care, and they just care about their audience size on Twitter. And that's fine. I still think it's worth doing. And I'm optimistic, but I'm also realistic in the sense that it's like, we're only going to find out by trying. Yeah, I mean, I certainly hope that isn't the future we're looking at is where people still commit to Twitter above all else and don't see the benefit of these decentralized social protocols. But I think even as it stands today, I mean, I personally haven't really used Mastodon or BlueSky much, but having used Farcaster and Lens quite a bit, I think it seems to me like the audience segments on both platforms are already a little bit different, where it seems to me like Lens has really optimized for growth and kind of just trying to like onboard as many people as possible. And contrasting that to Farcaster, where the barrier to entry into Farcaster has been a bit higher. And maybe that is intentional on your part in curating a higher quality group of people. And that's, you know, I think when people think about growth strategies, I think those are kind of like the two competing strategies and Rehash, we've really gone with the quality over quantity, like slow growth strategy as well, where we really wanted to build a community slowly and start small with a group of people who really understood what we were doing, what we were all about and aligned with our values before we expand it out to the public. Because especially in a space like crypto, like Web3, you get a lot of people who are just in it for the quick flip one token, a lot of spammers, and that was something that we tried to avoid. And it kind of seems to me, you know, and tell me if I'm on point with this at all, or if I'm totally off, but it seems to me like Farcaster kind of had that similar strategy of trying to grow slowly and intentionally to build a solid user base before expanding out to more of the mainstream.

# Sufficiently Decentralized Social Media w⧸Dan Romero ｜ S4 E8 [tUceJ4n2UIw]_part3

Yeah, so I think we've been intentional with our growth strategy for a couple of reasons. So there's a basic practical reason. We're on testnet still, and we need to migrate to mainnet next year. So every user that we have sign up one way or another, we have to actually pay. We're going to do the migration for the beta users to mainnet. So we're actually paying for people to move to mainnet. So there's a little bit of in our mind that it's not free. We're going to actually pay. And I think that that mentality is useful because I also think it feeds into the second point, which I think when you're starting an early social network, you're still trying to actually figure out norms of that social network and then the product surface area that need to kind of like match those norms. And if you grow too fast, you run into two issues. One, and this actually kind of applies to companies. And I kind of saw this a little bit at Coinbase when we were scaling quite a bit in 2017, 2018, is when you're a small company and people have been there for a while, people kind of know what the culture is and the norms and how things get done. But then if you get in kind of this hyper growth mode, the percentage of new people, so define that as like people who are new to the company within the last three months at any given time starts to get something like crazy. It's like 30% of the employee base at Coinbase during that kind of period of growth was new. And because so many people are new, you start to deviate away from what made the company and culture potentially successful before. And naturally, and this is not blame, this is how people work, is if you don't know what kind of the new norm and culture for that company is, you're going to just bring it in from whatever company it came in from before, Google, Microsoft, whatever. Similarly with the social network, if we grow really, really fast with Forecaster and you don't have enough time to kind of like marinate and really understand like, oh, this is how people do things here, what you're basically going to import is the culture of Twitter, which we can say there are some good things about Twitter and there are plenty of bad things about Twitter. And so I think where we wanted to be deliberate was in kind of just keeping, it's not like we haven't been onboarding people, it's just like onboard cohorts of people, a couple hundred people a week, and then A, let it settle with the existing culture of the network. And then similarly, there's another thing that I think is really important is consumers, you know, it's funny, people tend to like pretend consumers are somehow dumb or sheep or whatever when they refer to them for products. But actually I think consumers are really sophisticated. And so what they do is they're going to make a snap judgment about that onboarding experience, that initial kind of first few minutes they play around with the app. And then that's going to be kind of like seared into their brain. And when they think of, they hear the word Forecaster, whatever that first two minutes of using the app. And if you try to grow as fast as possible, then all of a sudden you have all these things that are kind of broken just because you haven't gotten around to polishing them up. And you have this culture that's not solidified enough. And so you actually, I think, burn through a ton of potential people who, if they had come in maybe a more deliberate and slow manner, might have actually found whatever product or social network you're building really engaging. And so I think where we've approached it is we have to move it to mainnet at some point. So like, there's kind of this constraint of like, don't grow too, too fast for it. And while doing that, try to figure out what the culture of Forecaster is, and again, match the feature set to that. And then the last point is like, pay a lot of attention on retention, right? So it's like, if you have a couple hundred people joining a week, you have enough data to kind of see it's like, okay, well, what percentage of those people come back on the kind of next day or day seven or day 30? And really try to hold yourself to a bar where you're not saying, oh, this is good for crypto. Like no, no, no, like we should be building a social network that's as good as a Web2 social network with the additional friction of having to create a username on chain. So it's like, that's the only way you're actually ever make something that's competitive with like a Web2 network is you're not competing against Web3 stuff. Actually attention is a zero sum game, and people are already using the Web2 stuff. So you actually need to build something so compelling that they're willing to reduce the amount of time they're spending somewhere else to spend in Europe. So like, just approaching it like that, for us means there's a ton of work to do. And you know, growth at all, by all means, early on is not what we're focused on. Can we actually sustainably continue to grow and build something that people find actually really valuable? And if we do that over the course of two years or so, I think we can get to a place where when we do kind of shift maybe a little bit more on a how can we grow this network to be as big as possible. A lot of those basics are really well defined and handled in that kind of first user experience in the app. I really like what you said about how you're competing with Web2 social apps and not actually Web3. And I think this is something that a lot of Web3 builders, not just in the social space, but across the board, tend to forget. I think people in Web3 tend to build for their friends who are also on Web3 and forget that, you know, like the majority of people out there are still very much living in a Web2 world and haven't gotten there yet. So I just wanted to double underline that part of what you said. We did get a ton of questions from the community, from Twitter and from Warpcast. So I'm going to go through some of our community questions and see how many we can get through with the time we have left. The first one comes from Sai Winther Tamaki from Warpcast, says, are there any apps you haven't built because of Apple's app store restrictions? That's something that you had mentioned earlier in our conversation. And then I'm just going to tack on to that and ask, you know, what other apps have been built on Farcaster so far other than Warpcast, if any? And then I know you've also got a list of, I think, about 50 app ideas that you have to be built on Farcaster that you would love to see be built. So I'd also be curious to hear, like, which of those ideas you're most excited about. And then, like, what's the call to any devs listening about how they can go about building an app on Farcaster? Well, for any devs listening to the call, and if you're not on Farcaster, if you send me a DM on Twitter, DWR, and you use the word Arizona, it's just like a keyword I use to search. So find people who made the proof of work through the podcast, I'm happy to give you a Farcaster invite. So going back to the Apple, I think Apple has some pretty strict restrictions on two things that I think in the scheme of things would be beneficial to the Farcaster ecosystem. So the first is, like, the idea of having an app store within an app store, right? Like, we want to actually surface more apps that are being built within the Farcaster ecosystem from our own app, Warpcast. But if it looks like an app store in your app, Apple doesn't like that. So I think we have to be a little bit more thoughtful about how we do that. One other way we can do that is desktop and web, which are not in an app store. So maybe that's one way to approach it. But I would love the ability to actually showcase other apps in the ecosystem in a way that kept Apple happy. But that's the rule for now. I think a second one is just NFTs are pretty tricky, because I think currently they fall under the in-app purchase digital good categorization, similar to buying gold tokens in a game. I think if you're more sophisticated, you kind of realize that that's not the case, but that's the rule. And so I think that there are probably some NFT features that we would be excited about adding if the rules allowed it. I think on the just, like, general ecosystem, so last year at this time, I think we had, like, maybe one or two people who had just tinkered with something on top of the Farcaster protocol. And a year before that, it was just us. Whereas I think now we're at a point where, you know, we have dozens of apps to different degrees of sophistication. A lot of just kind of like weekend projects, people scratching an itch, playing around with the data. And then I actually just mentioned this to the team today. There are three venture-backed teams now working within the Farcaster ecosystem, which, you know, for a year-over-year growth, that's, like, pretty good from a developer ecosystem. So I think that the level of sophistication and or resources that are starting to be invested in Farcaster apps is growing, which is exciting. But one thing that's neat about a protocol is that you don't have to have venture-backed money or sophistication. Like, if you have an idea for an app, you can just go build it. And maybe the audience of that might be only, you know, you or 10 people, but you can still do it and you don't have to worry about us coming around and doing what Twitter did is, oh, okay, API is now paid. Like, you need to pay me to do it. Like, so if you want to create a bot that just kind of does something, I don't know, irreverent or silly, great, go for it. And so I think that that is an important characteristic of a permissionless network is you can have a whole range of different size and sophistication of teams, and that's completely fine. And if anything, like, I think what makes a network like Farcaster or a protocol like Farcaster special is that irreverent, like, you know, single developer who just had a wacky idea on a weekend. And sometimes those things turn into something way bigger or they don't, and it doesn't matter. And so the thing I tried to do recently, because I had a lot of people like, oh, I want to build this or that. And I kind of wanted to just, as an exercise, broaden the horizons of, like, what could you be building on top of Farcaster? And I put a post together, about 50 ideas, and I was pretty clear. It's, like, lightly edited, haven't really thought too, too much about each of these. They might not even be good, you know, app ideas and or business ideas don't, like, come back to me and no one used the product. Why did you give me that idea? But it was more about, like, I think naturally, when you build on something new, you kind of look to see what's working. And in our case, like, we have this app that looks very similar to Twitter. Because I think a lot of the initial apps have been kind of Twitter-like. But I do think we're starting to see people working on different form factors. And again, maybe clones of other existing social networks that they know work, like something that looks like Instagram Stories, or a Be Real equivalent. But I think where you get to, and this happens with any new technology, is the initial set of people tinkering around tend to be a little bit more skeuomorphic of what existed before, right? So the original way of putting information on the internet for a traditional publisher was like, we're going to try to make this look like a magazine, whereas obviously today, like a web page has a distinct look versus printed media. And so I think it just takes some time as people need to kind of like be using the apps and or the protocol for some period of time where they can actually start to develop that more native mechanism for that new kind of primitive technology. And I think a good example of this in Ethereum and in DeFi, early Ethereum, the kind of like bet for decentralized exchanges was something like 0x, right? Which actually, if you look at the kind of way things are architected there, you had a bunch of these other clients that got built on top of 0x. Coinbase actually bought one in 2018, I think it was Paradex. And basically, the idea was, you were going to have these like order books or whatever, and you could kind of do these trades. And it didn't really gain any liquidity. And then a few years later, you got to Uniswap, which is actually a fundamentally new model. But you kind of realized that the AMM model, given the constraints of a blockchain is actually like a superior way to do some of this. And obviously, it's been phenomenally successful. And so I think that's like the thing I'm excited about is like what people are building today is like, that's kind of like a necessary part of the evolution of a protocol. But where I get really excited is just thinking about two or three years from now, the completely and wacky new ideas that people are going to be trying out that in aggregate, a bunch of them probably fail, but maybe a few of them work, or they actually fundamentally find some new social primitive or way of expressing, you know, just human creativity that maybe takes off. And so I get excited about the idea that you as a developer, don't have to ask anyone permission to start building a forecaster. Like if you if you're inspired at, I don't know, 10pm on a Friday, and you want to work the whole way through the weekend on some new concept, you can. Because Twitter API for a while for the last 10 years is like, you have to wait for them to give you an API token, and then they're going to rate limit you. And like, it's just like, all those little pieces of friction add up. And so I think getting to a place where it's just like you and a keyboard and an internet connection go like, that's, that's what I'm really excited about. Amazing. We are coming up on time. So I'm going to throw a couple of random non forecaster related questions at you from the community. And then we're going to wrap up with the game that we conclude every episode with. So the first sort of random question I've got from the community. This comes from sure, I'm gonna screw up your name. I'm so sorry. Sure. Pani Palakodetti wants to know, what would you major in in college if you were just graduating high school this year? Computer Science. Okay. Is that what you actually majored in? I was an English major. So okay, I regret I regret that as a as a major. So I would major in computer science. Okay, cool. Haydes from Warpcast wants to know, do you not like memes anymore? I don't know if this is in reference to something that I'm missing. But what are your thoughts on memes? I still like memes. Just been busy the last couple of weeks with, you know, the whole SVB blow up last Friday. You like, normally, there's a meme Friday on Forecaster, and I didn't do it last Friday. Okay, okay, we're gonna we're gonna do it this Friday. Okay, well, yeah. Blow up. How about that? Haydes was really upset about that. So So make sure just for Haydes sake that you know, we do another meme Friday. And then last one on a scale of one to 10. How happy do you feel with your life? This comes from Les Grace. I think eight and a half. That's pretty good. Yeah, I have a wonderful family. I feel really blessed and health is something that easy to take for granted. Yeah, eight and a half. That's a great answer. I actually love that question. I think I'm going to start asking all of my guests that question just to do a little mental health check and make sure everybody's doing okay. Cool. So I've got this. I wrap up every episode with the word association game. I'm sure you've played this before at some point, but basically, I'm going to say a word and I've got a box of words here. There's probably like 50 slips of paper in here. And these are often misused or overused words in web three. And I'm going to say a word and you say the first word that comes to mind. Got 10 of these. It should take us less than 60 seconds if all goes well. Great. Okay, cool. So first one. Governance. Nouns. Community. Nouns. Okay, so the not to censor. Okay, FWB. Okay. Yeah. So no, don't repeat. Don't repeat the word I say or the word that you already said. Ownership economy. NFTs. Merkle tree. Vitalic. Permissionless. Forecaster. Concentric circles. Growth. Media. Bankless. Dow. Maker. Layer two. Optimism. Substrate. I like how you just chose a proper noun for each word that was said. That's a good strategy. Good job. That went through. That went exactly how it was supposed to go. Sometimes it doesn't go so smoothly. Thank you so much, Dan, for coming on the podcast, giving us your time. I learned so much. And I'm sure our listeners did as well. Last thing before you go, tell people where they can find you if they want to follow you personally. I'll also remind people of the secret word to DM you with if they would like a Forecaster invite. And then also feel free to plug away at anything else, anything else you want people to check out or take a look at. Share all the links, all the handles. Yeah, look, just send me a direct message on Twitter. It's the easiest way to contact me for now. DWR. I'm the little pirate. I look at all of my DMs. And I think if you don't have a Forecaster invite, Arizona. But even if you do and or have feedback, I try to engage in good faith with everybody. So if you have thoughts and reasons you think you would use Forecaster, if there's something different about it, I'm open to that. Amazing. Cool. And then don't forget to check Forecaster on Fridays for Meme Fridays if you like memes. Thank you so much, Dan. Thank you listeners for tuning in.

# Web3 w⧸ Me： Freedom to Choose = Better World [Hdy9UEqL9nw]_part1

My guest today is Dan Romero, CEO and co-founder of Farcaster, a decentralized social media protocol. Dan was an early employee in 2014 at Coinbase, where he led business development that laid the groundwork for Coinbase's fiat rails. He started Farcaster after becoming obsessed with the idea that RSS, the protocol upon which this show and all other podcasts are broadcasted, could be used to compete with Twitter. We'll take a look on how better thinking can result from creating a permissionless protocol that is optimizing feed algorithms for quality of conversation. Also we discuss Dan's contrarian take on why filter bubbles are actually a good thing. One of the core beliefs for myself and this show is that if we facilitate open and honest discourse it will lead to better decisions and therefore better outcomes for the entire world. After speaking with Dan, I can see how the success of Farcaster can directly contribute to this. LFG baby, let's start vibing. Zach French is a bar certified attorney and nothing expressed by Zach during Web3 with me shall be considered legal advice. All the opinions expressed by Zach and his guests are solely their own opinions. All content in Web3 with me is for informational purposes only. Zach and his podcast guests may maintain positions in the securities discussed during Web3 with me. Welcome to the show, Dan. Thanks for having me. I've been really excited about this conversation. Because you and I talked pre-recording a few weeks ago, I think that your application and your protocol are one of the most mentioned things by my group of friends in Web3 about where I should be focusing more of my resources. So I get to peel back the layers with you today. So I'm excited about that. Excited to chat. Cool, man. Well, I typically start these interviews with my audience getting to know you a little bit better, getting to know what makes Dan Dan. Call it your founding story, so feel free to start wherever you'd like. So I'm originally from the East Coast. Spent the first 18 years of my life there and even college and a little bit after college. And so roughly, I think it was like 25 or so, I moved out to Silicon Valley and started working in tech, like kind of always had been a dream of mine. And the first year I was in Silicon Valley, everyone had an opinion on Bitcoin and I had originally dismissed it as a Ponzi scheme. Like the actual backstory is I went to college with Fred Ersom, one of the two co-founders of Coinbase. And when I was first moving out to Silicon Valley, they just raised their series A. I think they just hired their first employee and they said, hey, do you want to kind of be an early employee at Coinbase? And I categorically dismissed what they were working on as a Ponzi scheme. It was like magic internet money. Like that's not what I came to Silicon Valley for. I want to work at a SaaS company. And sure enough, I am in Silicon Valley, you meet smart people, engineers, and everyone kind of has this point of view on Bitcoin and I'm completely ignorant to it. So finally get around to actually reading the Satoshi white paper, which if you've never read the white paper, I highly encourage it because it's cogent, it's short. Like you don't actually have to be that technical to understand it. And I think in reading the white paper and letting it kind of marinate a bit in my head, it started to shift where all I could start thinking about is, hey, this feels like a completely new paradigm, right? Like it's a new type of primitive and Chris Dixon has this phrase where it's like a computer that can make commitments. And so I got really excited about this potential of like what new things can people go build with this permissionless public blockchain, right? And so I ended up joining Coinbase in 2014. I originally started on the BD side of things, kind of trying to get merchants to accept Bitcoin as a payment method, but then quickly moved into managing the fiat partnerships for Coinbase. And if you think of Coinbase as a business, take fiat currency, swap it into crypto and vice versa. So those relationships are critical for the business to work. And so first did it internationally and then started doing it in the US and it's actually relatively timely given all the news in crypto right now about banking. Basically I was the first customer for all of the major crypto banks in the US. Like Coinbase was one of the only companies at the time, one of the only regulated companies at the time. And so spent a lot of effort trying to kind of establish and then maintain access to the fiat banking system. And I think one reason that this is hard is I think the average consumer thinks about if they want to go open up a bank, you just walk into a bank branch or you could probably do it in an app today, no problem. You fill out a few questions, you're good to go. Even with a company, like you can go get an account with Mercury or something like that. You don't even have to talk to them. But if you want a bank account that is actually processing payments back and forth, that requires like kind of a special onboarding process. And so you actually are almost reverse selling to the bank. Like you're trying to convince the bank why you should accept us as a customer and take our money. Is that considered a merchant account in that instance? Essentially, yeah. It's like a wholesale banking account. So you have direct access to the core fiat payment rails, whether that's ACH in the US, wires, or card payments is a completely different set of network. So I managed that and then ultimately ended up managing the entire consumer business for a period of time. So think of like Coinbase.com mobile app. I was the first GM of that business. Not good morning, but like a gentleman. Just for you Web3 people out there. Yeah. So I spent five years at Coinbase. Kind of the first few years, things were pretty sideways. There wasn't much growth. And then 2017, we had like a crazy year where we 100Xed a ton of metrics. Like went from 10 million in revenue to a billion dollars in revenue. Like company really grew up, like loomed in number of employees. We hired a bunch of executives. And then kind of over the next couple of years, I was basically in senior management, but it's still kind of middle management where it's like I had a much smaller scope of role. And still interesting, but I think that the initial growth of Coinbase was where I learned the most. And so I think once the company was in a relatively stable place, we'd hired out a full executive team like Emily Choi. I interviewed her. She's now the COO at Coinbase. I felt like it was kind of like my time to leave. So left in 2019, took a year and a half off. COVID extended that a little bit. Spent a ton of time traveling, reading, and got to a place where I was bored, which I thought was a good thing to then figure out what I wanted to do next. And then just so happened to reconnect with an ex-Coinbase colleague of mine, Vrun Srinivasan, who had run large engineering teams at Coinbase, similar, kind of like started early and grew up within the organization. And then we just started batting our ideas around. Like it was like, okay, should we think about doing something here or there? And one idea that I had been really excited about for a while, for almost a decade, is the idea of RSS, which is this kind of old school, boring, permissionless protocol, which by the way, this podcast is going to be distributed via RSS. If you're getting this via Spotify or Apple Podcasts or Google, the underlying plumbing that's pushing the podcast out is RSS. So it's still very much in use today. But from a consumer use case, it's basically fallen off. Google had this product called Google Reader and they shut it down in 2013. And there's really nothing that's been nearly as mainstream because basically what people did is they just shifted to Twitter or these kind of like feed-based mobile apps, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, whatever. So I had this idea that for a while, and it's inspired by a Paul Graham essay from 2009, that Twitter is this weird company that is a protocol that somehow, instead of being kind of this neutral thing, like most protocols, ended up within a company. And I kind of always had this idea. I was like, well, what could you do with RSS, which is an actual kind of permissionless protocol? How could you improve it enough that it could actually start to be competitive with Twitter? And so Varun and I started to explore this idea. The original name for the idea was RSS+, which two and a half years later is now Farcaster, which if you think of like Farcaster at its core is about, I put a message out on the internet and now people who want to see that message are going to get that message delivered to them in real time. And so I'm happy to talk a little bit more about that. But for the last two and a half years, I've been working on Farcaster. Yeah. I want to get more into that because I know one of the things that I was thinking about as I was preparing for the interview was how to visualize the Farcaster stack. But before we get into that, I want to talk about how you've kind of identified at your time at Coinbase that, and one of my former guests used this, that you're more of a person that likes to play with kittens, not cats. Some people are built more for the fast paced, do a lot of everything environment that is presented in startups. And then some people prefer to be in a fully scaled organization where everything's operationalized and you're building processes and making it repeatable and all that kind of stuff. Is that kind of like the place you found yourself in when you kind of hit that like hyper growth mode, if you will, in the Coinbase? Yeah, I think I can play in both worlds. And I think I did okay as like, you know, an exec within the bigger organization of Coinbase. But my passion and my heart lies in just building new things. And I think to your point, it's a kind of like archetype of you're either into that or you kind of like the bigger scale. And so the idea that I could go back to working on a small team, you know, with a co-founder like Varun is just that seems way more enticing. One of the actual things we're doing with our... So our company is Warpcast, whereas Farcaster is the protocol. The analogies I always like to make, email to Gmail, Ethereum to Metamask, Farcaster the protocol to Warpcast. But Warpcast is the company. So we're kind of like building the initial version of the protocol, but also building our own app on top of it. We're going to keep the Warpcast team really small. So it's like, I think the magic, like Jeff Bezos has this concept of two piece of teams and just this, like keeping a team really small where you don't actually have to have a layer of management is like, to me, the Pareto optimal way of like going and building something because right now we have roughly 10 people like Varun and I can kind of manage the different people who are working on stuff, but it's really like a one-to-one relationship. It's like one person is working on the feature end to end and then kind of like paired with myself or Varun. And that I just feel is like super energizing. I'm really excited to show up to work every day because there's no overhead or like if we have one meeting a week, it's like the team meeting and that's it. And so this like being able to actually be as close to the metal as possible is just like the amount of energy that I get being able to do that compared to sitting in eight hours of zoom calls every day, managing effectively, which is like HR. It's just a completely different experience. And at least right now that like that's where I want to be spending my time. And so it's been really fun that for the last two and a half years, like basically just wake up every day and think about like, okay, what's the next thing for the protocol and what's the next thing for the product. I love that. So you've got kind of this, like you're always building mentality. And I imagine that includes providing a bunch of autonomy for the people that work for you to empower them to go make their own decisions so that they are not having to schedule a weekly one-on-one with you to go over each little thing they're doing. Yeah. And it's actually, it's a reflection of, I really enjoy autonomy and work like the magic of being early at a startup. It doesn't, not just Coinbase, but any company that goes through hyper growth is if you're early, you generally have like, you have to work on the hardest problems and then you have a ton of autonomy and being able to figure it out. Whereas naturally as a company gets a lot bigger, you just have more coordination costs. And so the autonomy decreases because you actually spend a lot more time building consensus and getting people aligned. And so the classic example is like, you have the meeting, where in theory that's where you do the alignment, but then you have the pre-wire and the pre-meeting before the meeting. And then as the organization gets bigger, it's like you have the pre-meeting before the pre-meeting, it just becomes this completely different game. And I actually think one thing that's interesting is if you look at early startup employees, how they kind of scale within a company that grows really fast, not everyone does, including myself, because they don't actually have the same skillset of if you start to bring in a professional management team, they understand the game that is the coordination of a big company and execs and managing personalities and all that other kind of stuff. Whereas the early stage startup employee is used to just being like, okay, we have this problem, how do we fix it? When can we fix it? Next problem. Like at an early stage, all you're doing is you're moving from one problem to the next problem without a loss of enthusiasm. I think I'm kind of paraphrasing someone else's quote, but that's effectively early stage startups. And then big stage startups that already kind of have an established business, it's a kind of about like, okay, how do you coordinate within this new kind of meta diplomatic political game? It's a Rorschach test. You can view that as like politics are terrible versus like, no, this is actually just the skillset that you need to do when you're managing a large organization of people. Yeah. Well, there's an aspect of sales and politics, right? And like that you have to be able to sell yourself. And I think the people that have friction with it kind of treat it as an unnecessary step. Right. But in reality, if you are able to sell your idea, sell yourself and do all that, you can establish yourself in these big organizations and start to move up if that's your goal. I think the difference is, at least in my experience is when I've been at larger organizations that eventually like you want to do something greater and like that can start as a side project in the organization and whether or not that gets adoption can depend on your ability to play that politics game, whether or not it's practical. That's when the frustration comes. But yeah. Yeah. I think just to simplify, like generally what happens at an early stage startup is you're doing external sales and then at a late stage startup or big company, it's actually a lot of internal sales in addition to your external sales. But I think Peter Thiel nails this in zero to one and I highly recommend it. Everyone who if they haven't read it, go read it. I need to reread it. Yeah. You can do a self reading or you can Blake Masters, who I guess now is a little bit of a different character, but he was the original one to take the notes. And he has the chapter on sales and marketing and Peter brings up a line, which I now kind of parrot is the field of dreams line. If you build it, they will come. That's a fallacy. Right. And so it's like every company, every idea that you kind of all these successful companies, there are some version of sales. Right. And if it's a consumer product that you can't actually do one to one sales for, that's called marketing. Right. And so it's like actually it's like you're trying to mass market consumer psychology. How can you actually pitch something that really resonates with people to bring them in? And if it's enterprise or something that's a little bit more narrow, then it's a hand to hand combat of sales. And so the most underrated skill in Silicon Valley is sales. And I think for engineers who I think typically are more systems thinkers, deterministic, sales sounds really frustrating because it's extremely messy because you're dealing with real people who are extremely complex. They're irrational or can be rational. It depends on the day. And I think the most useful thing is if you think about games, whether it's a board game or video game, there's a concept of the meta and the strategy that you need to figure out how to do it. And I think if you reshift sales as a category, whatever you're trying to do, whether it's internal or external, and you just think of it as like a game, it actually starts to become a little bit more systems thinking and a little bit more deterministic and actually can start to give energy. But going back to the point is if you're ultimately having to sell humans, humans are, it's draining, right? Like talking to another person. And so maybe you're naturally a little bit more introverted. I'm actually extremely introverted, but I play an extrovert on TV. The thing is, is though it's like it requires some level of extroversion to go and actually play this game. And so that's where I think sales gets this huge kind of like misconception within Silicon Valley. Although, you know, experienced people get this and Peter Thiel explaining it is important, but especially as we talk about what three in crypto, it's like the least sales oriented tech category that I've ever been a part of because people kind of have this fallacy of like, oh, well, if I just built this beautiful blockchain, everyone will just naturally adopt it because the technology is better. And if you actually look at a lot of the successful companies, projects, whatever, in terms of tractions, total number of sales, they're actually really good at sales. Like the one of the memes that exists is like Polygon, which I think has done an amazing job with all these partnerships. Why? Because they've actually done the sales, right? Not because necessarily the technology is better or something like that. And so I think that's one piece of advice I always give to entrepreneurs, like especially when I'm angel investing is you have to will the thing into existence through sheer force of personality and sales. Like the likelihood that you just like build this beautiful product and then everyone just kind of agrees that we should all use this and it just takes off and viral is just like it's like fake thinking. And actually, in most cases, I actually think if you peel back the onion behind most apps or kind of like these overnight success stories, there was some amazing sales or marketing at the beginning that they really nailed and they hit that seam. And yeah, then they got this kind of like really nice tailwind on their growth. But it really, really comes down to is like, can you actually figure out how to sell those initial people or market to those initial people? Wow, there's so much I need to unpack there. I want to start with one. How do you take your own advice at Warpcast in terms of what you just said? Well, I onboarded the first 400 users to Forecaster via Zoom call. So basically something equivalent to this. I mean, obviously this is a podcast, but hop on. I would screen share. I would give like a five minute overview presentation of just trying to explain because sometimes it's a little difficult if you're kind of using this app that we're trying to make feel similar to Web 2 and like really easy user experience. You're not realizing that there's a lot of stuff under the hood that's actually interesting from a protocol and decentralization standpoint. No consumer actually really cares about that. They just care. It's like Steve Jobs designs how it works. It's like the app is the only thing that matters. And so then I spent the rest of the call going through onboarding with people. And so it's really humbling to go through 400 onboardings where when you initially ship the thing, there's a whole bunch of kind of like polish that you haven't even figured out what to go polish. It's like, oh, that word is confusing or like this screen, which is intuitive to you because you spent hours working on it, is actually not intuitive to another person. And so going through those first 400 people, I think we really were able to kind of understand like how do you actually do onboarding in a way that is seamless and kind of good user experience. The other thing that's humbling is of those 400 people, I would imagine, not imagine, I know about 350 of them were, these are friends, right? Like 400 friends, but it's like one degree of separation. 350 of them just didn't come back. Right. And so it's like the only thing I got out was about 50 people, some who would use the app daily, very, very few. And then some people weekly and monthly. But I think that is like, it's a to borrow Paul Graham line, do things that don't scale. Like yes, you're never going to get to millions, if not billions of people on a social network doing hand to hand combat of onboarding. But you do get a really good sense for kind of like the pain points in your product early on. And if out of those 400, you do get a couple of, you know, tens of users who are actually going to continue using the product. That's better than being in a place where you're the only user. And so to kind of like think about orders of magnitude, any new product, like especially a consumer product, you can be your first user. In theory, you can go find 10 people, but actually to get 10 people to consistently use the app, you probably need to try to go onboard a couple of hundred people. And then to go from 10 to a hundred, you probably now need to start shifting the strategy, which in my opinion, is a huge step forward.

# Web3 w⧸ Me： Freedom to Choose = Better World [Hdy9UEqL9nw]_part2

case, I shifted over to this kind of gimmicky DM me if you want an invite. So no, like, yeah, but here's the thing. So the average person is like, oh, that's, that's never going to scale. Right. So I already did something that didn't want to scale the zoom calls. Then I said, DM me on Twitter, which, you know, RIP my inbox. But what was interesting about it is there's a little bit of friction and proof of work. And Twitter actually has this really interesting thing. And I started to follow more people on Twitter within crypto Twitter is I can see the mutuals and you could quickly see people who, oh, interesting. So it's like 80 people I'm following also follow this person. I don't even know who this person is, but that seems kind of interesting. And so could start to filter a little bit of like, okay, in a world where I'm doing a little bit more top of funnel marketing rather than sales, how can I continue to grow the network with some amount of quality? And that that strategy took probably like several hundred tweets of me on a regular basis being like, if you want an invite to Forecaster, or it's like, whatever the thing of the day would be. I'd post something about Forecaster or an idea and be like, if you're interested in this, please DM me. And sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn't. And it's just like the persistence of that over, you know, call it nine months of like, I just would wake up every day. And that's what I'm starting my day with is just managing my Twitter DM, DM inbox. And so we're finally getting out of that world. Like I'm doing about a lot less because now we have user driven invites. And so we're at 10,000 users now. And I think so for me to think about, it's like, okay, how do we get from 10,000 to 100,000 that's actually an unsolved problem for us. And so we're actually in the process of figuring it out right now. We're going to try a bunch of things. And hopefully I can come back a year from now and tell you, it's like, this is the thing that we did from the 10,000 to 100,000. That still is effectively sales and marketing. It's just you have to shift your tactic when you're doing a new order of magnitude. Yeah, that's interesting. I, having done a little bit of research for the episode, realize that, you know, you are laser focused on the kind of core web three audience, right? You're not trying to onboard new people to web three as quickly as you're trying to provide people in web three, a platform or a client or an app, however you want to phrase it, to go and communicate with other people who are interested in the space. Do you see that kind of shifting from 10 to 100,000? I know it's a little early, but. I don't think so. To 100,000, I think we can still be in quote crypto Twitter world. And so people who like our target audience, even up to 100,000 and maybe beyond that, they haven't met a mask already. Like use that as a simple proxy. Right. And so you can kind of look at some of the stuff like ENS is over a million unique addresses. Yeah, there's probably some dupes there, but even if you just say, okay, on average, everyone has two, then it's still 500,000 potential people who were sophisticated enough to go get an ENS. So I think orders of magnitude, 100,000, we're well within the realm of like someone who's what I would call crypto savvy. Right. So we started the 10,000, I think are like the most, you know, kind of bleeding edge. These people live and breathe crypto, whereas that next 90,000 people are people who are curious enough, especially in kind of maybe the mania of 2021, where they kind of wanted to play around with an ENS or NFTs or things like that. So that's what we'll be focused on. Are you guys going, I mean, is there any ideas around like partnerships to kind of grow like with specific like Web3 or crypto communities? I think it's an area we'll experiment with. I think the challenge there is, okay, so I have a discord. Let's say I have a really engaged discord of 5,000 people, 10,000 people. I go and say, hey, do you want to onboard that entire discord to Farcaster? So first of all, a bunch of those people, if it's like, you know, you think of this as actually a relatively small community of very active people, they're already on Farcaster. Okay. So now you onboard the rest. Are those people now going to be using Farcaster or are they going to continue to use the discord that they've already invested time in? And this is actually a problem we have had to confront and solve at least each amount of scale that we've reached is that there's this kind of framework I love to think about when building a consumer product is stated versus reveal preference. And the best example of this is Henry Ford's famous quote, if I had asked my customers what they want, they would want a faster horse. And so I think the kind of way to think about it is people actually don't really know what they want sometimes. Like in certain instances, yes. Like if it's like a very like well-defined thing, but with new technology and new products, it's your job to actually come up with the product and then be able to actually solve it with the consumer by maybe having an insight into like what their problem is or what the revealed preference of kind of like what they will use or do. But stated versus reveal preference is also something where people like to tell you what they think you want to hear. Like it's just natural human behavior. You go on board, you're 400 people in crypto having worked in crypto for almost a decade. And you're like, hey, check this out. You've said you're really interested in decentralized social, like it's imperative that we get there. Like you're really pro web three and crypto. That's the stated preference. The reveal preference of all these folks is they've got tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of Twitter followers that they worked really hard to build that audience. Why would they go spend any amount of time on a new protocol where they might have a hundred followers, right? Outside of like pure ideological alignment, which there are a few people in the world like that, but actually very few. The reveal preference is what people, people have a limited amount of time. So what they're going to do is they're going to use where they have their biggest audience. Until by the way, at some point they might lose that audience because they get banned from Twitter. And then they're riled up of like, wait, I wish I had actually been building this kind of in a protocol where maybe I can control it. And so where I think what we've found is the reveal preference of users is to find the people who don't have as much invested in another platform, whether that's Twitter or YouTube or discord and actually kind of target them. And when they start to build an audience on Farcaster where they now have more followers or kind of an audience size that's bigger on Farcaster than they have on a legacy platform, they've converted to becoming like a full Farcaster maxi in the sense that this is now more valuable to them than that other platform. And my friend Eugene Wei has an amazing essay. It's very long, but it's worth reading. Status as a Service. That actually specifically calls this point out where you can almost think of it as, and it's like a rough analogy that is like immigration, right? So it's like if you're in the upper class or the nobility of the original country, you probably don't have as much incentive to leave. Whereas if you're kind of like at the bottom of the hierarchy in terms of status or economics or whatever, you're more inclined to say, hey, maybe I'll move to the US, like that's land of opportunity, right? Like the new thing. And when you get there, you start out like everybody else. But as you build status in that new area, then you actually, it's a much more dynamic environment where now you can actually become one of the larger creators on this platform. And so Eugene talks about TikTok in the sense that each new big social media platform mints a new set of stars. And so I think we're in the early stages of that with Forecaster, but we have several people who have 5, 7,000 followers now on Forecaster having just a result of having been there early and active that is much bigger than their Twitter following. And so this becomes their default place to do distribution, which if there's some semblance of quality there can actually maybe kickstart a little bit of a flywheel where now other people are like, oh, these people are actually kind of interesting. I'm going to actually start using Forecaster because it's differentiated content and a graph than what I would get on Twitter. And so that's, I think, where it's taken us a while to get there with a bunch of mistakes in between, but like figuring out like the reveal preferences, find the people that traditional social media is underserved, but potentially are diamonds in the rough, and then actually get them to start using Forecaster and highlight that content and stuff like that. And so that's effectively what we've done over the last two and a half years. And if I think about like what we need to do over the next year, it's basically scaled up significantly. And so there will be probably a new set of tactics that we need to think about. So you've got kind of the, I guess, the stated versus revealed preference of the creators, right? The people that want to build a following, but just as important to those people are the people that want to be the voyeurs that engage in additional conversations that help add to those follower counts. Because let's be real, like creators don't always follow each other, right? Like they're trying to build their own fiefdom, if you will. What have you, have you done any exploration around that side or is that just so secondary just to get the good quality content onto Forecaster and content creators? What is that? So we've actually been pretty explicit. We have very limited set of algos in terms of like, if you just think of it as like, we have a following feed, which is kind of reverse chronological, but then we have something called highlights. So if you're familiar with TikTok or even, or Twitter, like the for you is effectively the algo and then following is more traditional for you following. And then we have a recommended set of users. And what we've done early on is we haven't done machine learning. It's actually just been heuristic based in terms of like what algo rules. And we explicitly try to reward people who are actively having conversations. So here's an example. I post really good tweets or memes or whatever. I show up on Forecaster. I just start automatically cross-posting, right? Cause I'm just like, okay, this is quality content. I'm going to go post it here. So two things happen. One, I use Forecaster, but I also see it on Twitter. I'm like, okay, this like, what is differentiated about this? And there's all this other stuff on Twitter. So like I should just use it on Twitter. So that actively hurts the value of the network. The second thing is if you are posting and people are actually in good faith, especially cause the network is smaller, are wanting to engage and then you don't reply, that hurts the value of the network. And so what we've really tried to emphasize is, so if you post and it gets a bunch of likes, but you're not really engaging or there's not a lot of conversation, the algo does not value that as much as a post that gets a lot of back and forth conversation. And so it's not overly complicated in terms of the algo. You can kind of think about it. But the whole point is we would rather highlight things that generate like back and forth on the network, real conversation, then kind of this broadcast and then try to hope for likes. Whereas Twitter doesn't do that. Twitter is, and I'm overly simplifying this, but like if you just think of their algo and their incentives, up until Elon, it was time spent because time spent means you see more ads and if you see more ads, they make more money. So time spent, if you just let the machine learning algorithm at scale go after that, it's naturally going to surface threads. So you have all these like, it's like, yeah, and it's like, you could have condensed this into like three tweets or one tweet. You turn it into 10 because now if I click through and I like kind of go through and I'm like, okay, get to your point, get to your point, get to your point. I am spending more time on that set of tweets, which if the algo's goal is to increase time because that increases revenue, then that's what you get. And so if you kind of think about Twitter, it is very, very broadcast and like people actually don't engage. Like, if you just look at like big crypto Twitter accounts, they don't really respond to their comments. And there's a whole bunch of other reasons like spam and like, you know, all this other kind of crap that Twitter hasn't figured out. But at a core, very few people are actually having conversations. They are broadcasting to their audience. And the other thing that Twitter has, which we haven't really implemented because we want to be careful about this, is what quote tweets do is if just think about the conversation you'd be having. So let's say you and I are having an exchange on Twitter and someone who doesn't like us comes in and quote tweets. Okay. That would be the equivalent of us having a conversation at a party, that person walking up and then screaming out to the rest of the party, hey, everyone, look how idiotic these people over here are, like by taking one tweet out of context, which if you think about it, like most people are not going to click through to that tweet. They're just going to see the like thing out of context with the dunk. And then like the dunk is, you know, ratio, like think of all these terms that we have from Twitter. And it's a function of, it's become a product and a network where it's very much about broadcasting to your tribe and your team. And so I think that with what we have, granted, we're way smaller, we don't have a bunch of these issues. You can't sign up just like out of the box. So Twitter is actually at a, like relatively for a centralized network, a permissionless state. So we want to give them intellectual honesty, like credit there. But the thing that we have an ability to do is because we don't have this ad driven model, is maybe we can actually shift the incentives and the core primitives and behavior on the network to be more oriented towards conversations by our choices and how we do an algo or kind of incentives on the network. And I think we're still trying to figure that out, that maybe it doesn't ever get as big as Twitter in, you know, maybe the next couple of years, but the quality of conversation is so much higher that that quality starts to attract other people to actually want to be the audience, right? Because quality is super hard to fake. And I think the thing that we're going to actually find out is the GPT revolution, as it applies to Twitter threads, I think is going to get so bad. Like in the same way that SEO got really bad. But like I think like the kind of threader GPT thing, it's like, here's the story of the day. GPT is now going to be able to, you know, take all this information in and do a 20 long thread and pull the... Just take any threader that you want is like, I'm pretty sure an LLM is going to be able to do that. And so then it's just Twitter is going to be overrun with it. I would imagine they're going to have to change the algo because it'll actually, people will start to use the app less. And what people will be craving is authentic conversations. And it's like, oh, this is like a one to one exchange between two people that, yeah, maybe it's LLM supported to like make it a little wittier. But the idea is like a one to one back and forth between two public people on a platform is like, that's actually what makes Twitter interesting. Obviously, it tends to be more negative, but like that's the opportunity I think for us in the near term with Mark Guster. I love that. I mean, I have, I don't know, have you been following Tim Urban's new book that just came out at all? I haven't had a chance to read it. I know he was working on it and then he apparently had their kid a little early. So like that was not originally part of the plan. But yeah, tell me about the book. Yeah, no, I've started the book. I have listened to five and a half hours of podcast of him talking about the book with Lex Friedman and Patrick O'Shaughnessy over on the best like the best. And it just the core concept is that there is low rung thinking, which is what we're kind of in as a society right now, which are these echo chambers. And a lot of the algorithm on Twitter is feeding these echo chambers. Right. And then there is high rung thinking, which is what he calls an idea lab, which means that we are having open, honest discourse about ideas and nobody is demonizing you for having a difference of opinion. When I think of what you are talking about, prioritizing for high quality conversations, I think you are promoting idea labs. Right. Whereas when I spend a lot of my time on Twitter and I scroll through and I see six different people posting a thread about the greatest prompts and chat GPT. And let me tell you about the secrets and ins and outs of the SVB bank failure. You know, it's it begins to get repetitive. Right. And like, you don't really get to have good conversations, because like you said, there's not a lot of incentive for the people with big followings to continue a conversation. It's more of an incentive to just broadcast it. Now, that doesn't mean that they're going to get demonized to the sense where what he calls a social justice fundamentalism, which is the woke culture. But I mean, I just there to be able to do something like that, to have more of a dinner party conversation than a podcast, even though obviously I'm a big fan of podcasts. Right. Like we are broadcasting this. I'm not in the in the chat talking to people and asking them, what do you think of what Dan just said? Right. But like, if you can do stuff like that, that's very high quality content. And I feel like from what you've just said, that's what you're trying to do. Right. Is create that space for people. And right now, people that are associated with crypto Twitter and Web3 to have those high quality conversations. And you've got that, by the way, you've got all the big names, in my opinion, already on there having the conversation. So I just I find that intriguing. And I think it's just totally on point with what he calls a self-help book for society. Right. This is what we need more of. Yeah. Yeah. And it's an interesting concept. I should I should check out the book. I think a couple of things. So, one, I actually have a contrarian take on filter bubbles. I actually think that they're completely OK if you can actually generate the idea lab content for tribe X or tribe Y in public, because then you can actually exchange those ideas even if you're not necessarily having a direct conversation, because that tends to be less civil. So imagine just a hypothetical scenario in a couple of years here where there are two major clients on top of Farkaster or decentralized social protocol. Right. And let's assume that we're all in kind of like one global commons for social protocol. And you have team yellow and team green, and they each have very different politics. OK. When you use team yellow's client, you don't see anything from team green. Like so if someone from team green at the protocol level responds with a quote dunk or whatever, and it's like, look at this idiot or like blah, blah, blah, like tech bro like this or like, you know, like blah, blah, woke person or like whatever. It's just all of that vitriol. You just don't see it. So what ends up happening is team yellow. Remember, all this is public, by the way, is having their conversation and stuff here. And team green can go read that content if they want, maybe a different client or whatever, and then vice versa. And so you're going to have those like low rung thinking people who just all they want to do is actually fight online. Like it's just entertainment. Like that's actually what they're there for. But you're going to have the higher rung people be able to actually at least engage in those ideas. And this does happen on Twitter today. It just gets drowned out. And so a really basic example of this is Noah Smith. He has no opinion on Substack. Like he kind of used to be within, I think, academia and or like traditional media. Now he's independent on Substack. And I think he's doing from a financial standpoint, probably better than he's ever done traditionally in any of that stuff. So now he has a direct line to his audience. I personally don't agree with a lot of what Noah says. I think he's generally a little bit more left than I am on the spectrum. But what's fascinating about Noah is he in good faith intellectually engages with basically every topic that he writes. And I find myself whenever I'm reading Noah, having to question my own set of beliefs because he's presenting in a logical and coherent argument. And so I think what ends up happening is if you can allow people to actually just express those ideas and engage in kind of whatever way they want, and somehow you can highlight the kind of higher rung thinking, even if we disagree, you're actually getting to an intellectual environment that's, I think, a lot more idealized. And the beauty of it is you just can drown out all the low rung thinking. And that can actually be a decision at the client level. So you can imagine you have that yellow client and the green client, and then someone chooses, I don't know, like the purple client over here. And the purple client just basically says, we're actually going to try to get the people from using AI, like super negative ad hominem attacks or whatever. We're just going to drown those people out. Or just like they're using like swear words or whatever.

# Web3 w⧸ Me： Freedom to Choose = Better World [Hdy9UEqL9nw]_part3

It's like, let's get rid of those. And then it's just like you're compiling what's actually happening at the protocol level between the people who are arguing good faith from team yellow and good faith from team green. And now you're exposed outside of these filter bubbles. You, if you choose the purple client, are exposed to a rich intellectual tapestry of all these different ideas. And we actually get to a much more idealized thing. But the key thing here is the people who build that purple client, they're free to go build that, right? You cannot do that on Twitter today. Twitter does not allow you to build third-party clients. And even if you go back to the regime that existed prior where you could build a third-party client like Tweetbot or TweetDeck, or no, TweetDeck, so Tweetbot or Twitterific, you still didn't have access to the full fire hose. And so it's not like you could actually build some algorithmic feed that's trying to surface the best of Twitter. The best you could get is like who you were following. And so I think in a world where you assume that the kind of like substrate for what's actually happening in this kind of like public open discourse is a protocol, you are gonna have a kind of marketplace of clients that can cater to different types of people. And I don't think you can actually go change human nature. So there are going to be people who want the blood sport that is Twitter and like team yellow versus team green, and that's okay. But there are gonna be a whole bunch of people who probably are interested in team purple because they're like, hey, this is actually great. Like I get exposed to the smartest people on the internet for free. And so that's like the idealized version of what we're trying to go build. Now, getting from 10,000 people in a crypto centric network to kind of this like global public commons, that's a lot of work between here and there. And I mean, that's what we're trying to figure out. Yeah, no, that's a good way of putting it. It's almost like the, and maybe there is an element of transparency that you add to your clients so people understand what you're filtering for, or maybe they just got to figure it out on their own as they interact with your client. But that level of transparency and publicity and what you are doing is actually allowing you to filter for the low run thinking, because everybody that is in the top notch of this are the best thinkers in the space. They just happen to lean one way. And I think that's what gets lost a lot is that there are a lot of really smart liberals, capital L liberals. There are a lot of really smart conservatives, right? But the way that you would portray them on Twitter right now, at least the way I think about it is like, oh, well, if they believe something I don't believe, then they must be bad, right? But like really, like they're really smart people and they have a reason. They have very clear reasoning, like you're talking about, that they believe in those things. And this is allowing people to make that decision for themselves. And I love that you combined it in the purple because obviously Forecaster's purple, but then they meet in the middle and they've got like this neutral ground where it's like, I actually just wanna understand the whole playing field. I guess how, like the other problem that's inherent in this is like tip the reason that people are so worried about how polarized things are right now and how everything is politicized is because the loudest voices in the room are typically the ones that get the most following and get the most coverage, get the most broadcast like reach, right? So the moderates, which is where I would consider myself, right? Like we haven't, like we aren't typically a loud people and that's what's kind of allowing these other like very polarizing sides to proliferate. Is there a way that you can allow the moderates to speak to these two polarized groups in a productive way? I don't know. Like, is that possible if you build the purple client? I guess is the question. So my, like, A, from a historical basis, I think polarization has always existed. And like, there's like this kind of nostalgia for some era that didn't exist. Like, it was like, people always disagree. Like politics have always existed, right? You want disagreement to an extent. And so it's like, what we have now is we're just online and like things move at the speed of the internet. And so, and there's always a recency bias. Everyone always thinks that they're living in like the pivotal moment in history. It's just like, that's how humans work, right? So like, there is no version where like, we live in the society where the extremes don't exist. And here's the wrinkle with the internet. Is the extremes traditionally did not have any means for distribution outside of within their own weird extreme, on both sides, right? Or, you know, if you think it's even multi-party on, and any side. What the current state of social media does, because it's centralized at scale, ad driven. So when you have an ad driven at scale model, time spent is the thing you care about. What is upstream of that? It's clickbait. Why? Because it's the most entertaining. It is genetically engineered. Like if you think of like Twitter as constant AB desk. Show me the incentives and I'll show you the man. Right, and so like, let's say you have this like really, and I actually, the reason I use the yellow green, because I think it's just like, as soon as you say red, blue, like people are like, they immediately shift into team mode, right? And so like, you know, it's like red and blue actually create purple, but I like using yellow and green, because you have no association for what that means, at least in the US, right? Some other countries where that means one thing. But if you basically have like an interesting thinker and team yellow, and then you have the high rung people and the low rung people, what will happen is that idea or thing that they're talking about, that they in good faith are like, how can we potentially solve it? Here are some, the way that it's like a game of telephone, it filters down to the low rung, and then they use the kernel and build something around it that just gets the most likely to click or the inflammatory thing that within that side, which by the way, they're doing it for their side, for the team to like get engagement, but what they actually want is the quote tweet from the other side to increase the distribution and the beef, right? Like there's a concept called the Streisand effect, where it's just like, you like any effectively, like any additional publicity, like if you try to tamp down something, it actually will increase publicity. And there's the traditional line, it's like any publicity is good publicity. It's like the fact that like you can say something inflammatory over here, that you get a bunch of likes on your team, drives the other team so crazy that they then turn it into an issue. It's like the account lives of TikTok. Like the whole reason that that account is so popular is not because there's a whole bunch of people who believe what it's saying. Yes, there are people like that. It's because the other side, it drives them crazy, right? And so your audience is actually 100% of the extreme people on both sides. And then the moderate people are in the middle kind of just being like, what the hell? It's like, it's just like a constant fight between these two people on both sides. And so that's where I think, again, it goes back to if you have that ability to have a marketplace of clients and you can opt into using a client that's like, I just don't wanna see either side of these extremes. Like I literally wanna see like photos of astronomy or like, and Reddit is actually a good example of this. Think of like subreddits where they're like more topical based. I just like literally wanna live in a client where I just never see like the two ad hominem sides of like, and deep fake videos and all this other kind of, like whatever literally the current thing on the internet that day is and team yellow and team green are fighting over. I just like, I wanna see like, what's the latest ML paper. And I don't actually wanna see anything about ML alignment because that's effectively a political issue. Just show me the like, I don't even wanna say ArcVix or whatever the like paper that came out. That's what I wanna see. And by the way, if you use a feed reader like today, like an RSS feed reader, it's like pretty esoteric and niche that's basically what you get. Like you can literally never have to worry about seeing some like crazy other thing outside of one of the blogs that you're choosing to follow decides to cover it. And if that blog gets to like, you're just like, man, like all they doing is talking about this like political stuff that I'm not that interested in. You just unsubscribe, boom, and you never see it again. And so it's like daring fireball, great example. I've been reading that blog for 15 years and he has a political bent, right? Like he's a liberal and like he hates Republican stuff and he loves Democrats stuff. And like that's just who he is. I go through those posts. I actually read them. I found out he's like, I think he's a smart person. So I'm curious of like how he's approaching that. But I'm not there for that. I'm there for the Apple content. If he went 100% politics, I would unsubscribe. Then I'm done. Like he's free to do that. He has his own website. And I'll just continue to read the other 300 blogs that I have in my feed that are talking about topics that I'm just a little bit more interested in reading. But so I think like what we can do is if we can get into a protocol based social network, you as the adult, assuming other people go build these clients and make these parameter choices, and maybe there'll be open source clients, which then you can tune just like a feed reader to whatever you want, you can opt into the version of the public square that you want. And if you don't want a whole bunch of other stuff and you're just like, I don't want this like blood, sport, entertainment, you don't have to follow it, right? And like here's a really basic example from traditional media. You ever watch the nightly news in the local market? Not really. OK, well, not today. But did you like growing up maybe? Yes, we were growing up. It was an event. You sat down at dinner and you might have turned it on. Right, exactly. It's just like that pre-internet, like that's how my parents would watch it every night. And whenever I was old enough to be able to stop, I'd watch it. It is the most formulaic, same thing every single night, where it's if there is a murder or a thing that is scary, that is the lead story. That's just like the way it works, right? And it's like, why are people doing it? Because it's kind of like, that sounds like entertainment, like in the sense that it's like it gives you something to talk about the water cooler the next day. And so people have been doing this forever. But I don't think anyone serious would have ever said watching the nightly news, the regional nightly news in wherever you are, compared to reading a couple of newspapers. Let's say you read the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, which have different points of view. Like, which of those two things is going to give you a better perspective on what's happening on the world? Watching the nightly news or reading those two things. And here's the thing. If you're reading the New York Times or you're reading the Wall Street Journal or The Economist, that's a filter bubble. That is an editorialized algorithm that shows up whether it's daily or once a week. But you opt into it. You could say, hey, you know what? I'm finding the Wall Street Journal's too radical on this or the New York Times too radical on that. And maybe I'll subscribe to the Financial Times, which is an international perspective, if that's what you believe in. But the whole point is that there is a marketplace of algorithms in news, at least traditionally. But I think as we've moved more towards Twitter, now the algorithm that is centralized there actually dictates effectively what the current thing is with the front page. And so moving back to a model where you as an adult get to make the decisions on what your diet looks like, because there are other opportunities for clients that actually respect that ability and say, oh, the consumer says they don't want to see this. We're going to do a really good job preventing you from seeing this, because maybe they're monetized via subscription. They don't have to worry about the amount of time spent you have in ads and things like that. So that's the world I want to get to, is actually just move it closer to web one, where everything is a website. And it's like you pick the websites if you like Drudge Report or you like Nothing to Post or Yeah, exactly, or Daily Kos. There's a rich tapestry of different levels of political extremism or what are talking points, memos, and other ones. I think that whole early internet culture of like, you could actually kind of pick the intellectual bent that you wanted, I think we're just missing that today, because so much of it is reduced to a single app's algorithmic decisions, which are focused on time spent, which inevitably turn into the bloodsport entertainment. Whereas Talking Points memo might have taken something that they saw on Breitbart or Drudge, and they do this big dunk takedown, but they don't get any additional distribution with the quote tweets and retweets and people dunking back and forth. It's like you had to actually go over there. And so that speed of the kind of fight, is the latency significantly increases, which I think requires a little bit more nuance and thought than the 140 character, I guess now technically it's unlimited on Twitter. But part of it is like, show me the incentives, like I'll show you the outcome, and also just the culture. And I think that that's where Twitter is today. And so what I'm hoping with Farcaster is because of the multi-client ecosystem that we help to propagate, you're gonna have dozens of different cultures and you can actually pick into the one that you- I think it's so necessary to have multiple cultures. I was actually talking about that this morning with a friend over coffee and you need all of these people available. I think what you're saying is that now we're giving me the power, the intent to engage back to you as an individual and you can choose what you want to do just as easy as you can subscribe or unsubscribe to a blog. Consumer choice. I think it's like, people wanna frame decentralized social as a censorship thing. Average person doesn't care about that. Maybe a creator, publisher, developer, like you can make the arguments that they're more sensitive to that, given that like they've built an audience or an app and they can have that rug pulled. The consumer, what they, they like markets where they have more choice because that means competition. And it means people are building apps that try to appeal to their unique set of needs, right? And so if you have a single app, they can just optimize for wherever they want because the only way to get access to that Twitter graph is through the official Twitter app. But if you now have a marketplace of those apps, maybe none of them are actually as big as a traditional centralized social media, but in aggregate, that marketplace solves for the kind of like unique needs of a wider variety of people. Just think about if the market for cars, okay, the only car you could buy is a Tesla. Do you think Teslas would be worse or better quality? You got no other choice. Switching costs, there are no switching costs. You can't switch. Here you go. Cars today. I, let's say I'm like super pro, like we need to reduce fossil fuel dependence and I wanna have an electric car. Now I have this conundrum, because I don't also like Elon, because I think I disagree with his politics or whatever. You have the freedom to either choose to use a Tesla, which I think by most people's estimate is the best electric car in the market. Or you can say, you know what? I am going to weigh the quality of my car relative to my dislike of Elon. And I'm gonna go buy, I don't know, a Nissan or like whatever equivalent alternative. But you as the consumer have the choice to be able to do that. Like that is actually important. And you can vote with like, I never wanna give that guy another dollar. Great, you're free to do that. That actually is infinitely, I think more impactful from like actually steering the way things work in society is if you can vote with your dollars and the market can actually say, hey, you know what? Tesla's actually starting to lose market share, despite if you just like ignored the logo and just like evaluated the car, because Elon's antics are so infuriating to the group of people that are interested in buying electric cars. I can guarantee you that will actually make Elon modulate a little bit more. That is like way more likely to actually get him to change how he's behaving than you dunking on him on Twitter. So it's like, I think like in a world where now all of a sudden, imagine Twitter actually had to be built on a protocol. Like it's just like, there's that hypothetical. Overnight, all of the people who dislike Elon would be switching to a different client. Whereas now they have to go to Macedon or, you know, Forecaster or whatever, but like Forecaster is not permissioned to sign up. So most of them went to Macedon and you've already seen this huge correction in the total number of people using Macedon because the reality is what they actually care about, the reveal preferences, that distribution. And so they're kind of sheepishly still using Twitter. And you can always see this, the people who make the loudest noise about going to Macedon, just go to their likes on Twitter, they're still on Twitter because you can see how recent their likes are. And so maybe they're not as publicly vocal, but the thing is they're probably spending a ton of time watching the app, even if they're hate watching it. And so getting to a world where you actually have this like kind of public comments on a protocol and someone you really dislike takes over the biggest client that you're using, you can just seamlessly move to another client. And then boom, you can continue to talk to your people. You don't have all this work that you have to go rebuild. Maybe there's a set of features with that new client that you actually really enjoy. Like, so that's the vision of what we're trying to get to. And it's just like, okay, well, we have 10,000 people in the network today. Like, how do we actually get there? I love that. I mean, and what you were just explaining with the client, with Elon, with Tesla's is something that has really been highlighted in the Web3 crypto Twitter spaces. The ability to buy things based on the way they identify who you are, right? You've got this kind of identity layer that has never been really super possible before, but you've just explained it that you can actually approach your car buying with that same level of identity is like, I actually went and got the Hyundai electric vehicle before I got the Tesla because I hate Elon, right? Not because it's a better car, because they just started making electric cars, but because of that. That's a really good analogy. I love that. Right, and so the idea is like consumer choice creates moderate behavior. Because if you go to extreme, yeah, you'll have your set of extreme customers over here, but assuming there's an equivalent someone can actually switch over to, they may not wanna go choose that, right? And like take another dumb example. Let's say my pillow built the best possible pillow. Like you just like objectively everyone, like if you did blind taste test or the pillow test, they would do that. I can guarantee you that like, if that was the scenario of the world, people would still not buy that pillow because they don't like the outspokenness of the politics of that one individual, right? But the pillow market is like an extremely low barrier to entry, right? So it's like, anyone can go build, you can build like, I mean, literally Purple is a company that like builds mattresses and pillows, but like the whole point here is when you don't have these monopolistic lock-in effects, you get a very dynamic consumer choice oriented market that if people wanna optimize for having the most pillows sold, I can promise you they're never gonna wanna do anything. They're just gonna wanna be like, I don't fucking love pillows. Like put your head on it and you're gonna go to sleep. And right, but like, that's the whole point. But when you start to get to these lock-in scenarios, you get to be king, like you can do whatever you want. And so, the irony of this whole situation is the group of people that don't like Elon with Twitter, right, we're the same group of people that, when they kicked Trump off, we're like, well, go build your own social network, like too bad. And so it's like intellectual, like just like not thinking through, like any system, you want the set of incentives so that if your worst enemy flips over to controlling the thing that you thought was like a given under your team, they can't abuse it. And so the way to do that is through open protocols that are credibly neutralized, credibly neutral and decentralized and permissionless. And so I think we're finally at a point in society where I think people, maybe not the extremes, but like the people who are actually kind of the high rung thinking on different sides of the political spectrum can all agree on generally.

# Web3 w⧸ Me： Freedom to Choose = Better World [Hdy9UEqL9nw]_part4

it's like, yeah, it would actually be kind of nice to have a decentralized, credibly neutral platform that no one entity can control. In the same way that we have with cars or newspapers or whatever. And the optionality if that changes. Market you can think of. That's beautiful. Well, we went on an awesome tangent for the entire episode. That was awesome, Dan. I do have to ask you my two traditional closing questions and I'll have to bring you on again if you're open to it because I think there's just a lot of interesting things happening in your space and you're kind of at the forefront. You have a front row seat to all this. So anyways, the two traditional closing questions that I have are, how do you describe Web3? Permissionless innovation and the ability to kind of have true ownership over things that are important to you. And it's not quite like own your data because I actually don't think that that matters as much. But the idea that if you have an audience, that relationship is directly between you and the audience and no one can kind of go and muck with that. So that to me, that's ownership. Gotcha. And then the last one's forward looking. Where do you see yourself in this industry, Web3 crypto in the next six to 12 months? And where do you see yourself in the industry five to 10 years from now? Six to 12 months, I think we're gonna be a pretty choppy environment for at least six months or a year, maybe longer. And so I think what we've really been focused on with Farcaster is just, we know what we wanna accomplish and try to keep focused and making progress and listening to feedback from the developers and the ecosystem and the people using the product today. So that's how I think of it as like, we're fortunate that we have plenty of funding so we can actually kind of be a little bit blinders, heads down. I think in the longer term, five, 10 years from now, I'm extremely bullish on some protocol breaking through and I hope it is Farcaster, but you never know. And so what I do think is five to 10 years from now, the core protocols that we're using for kind of social media I think will be X number of more clicks to centralize. I don't think centralized social media companies are going away. They have an insane scale and user experience. And I think the average user really likes using a lot of those products, right? It's like average person likes using Instagram and TikTok. That's just the reality. Now there are a whole bunch of other moving pieces, like whether it's political or kind of these trends. But I do think if the technology and kind of the early users can kind of bootstrap an ecosystem where there is an alternative, you're gonna start to pick off the types of creators who are saying, hey, I actually do wanna be kind of creating an insurance policy where I have a following on maybe something like YouTube, but maybe a decentralized version of YouTube. Because now if I lose access to that platform, I still have a way over here. And I think that the permissionless innovation that will start to happen in the kind of decentralized social networking protocols where anyone can go build a client, which doesn't exist on Twitter today, doesn't exist on Instagram or YouTube. I think that is the thing that we're like, if you think of it as like a little bit of a kindling of a fire that if we can really stoke and get going, then the new innovation that will start to come out of the kind of decentralized ecosystem of apps may actually be on par, if not better, from just like solving a consumer problem that they didn't even know had. And like people actually just wanna use because they're delightful new products. And so we're really, really early there because we're just still trying to get the ecosystem booted up and it's this kind of like, how do you will a flywheel into existence? But I think over the five to 10 year timeframe, if you just take it as a whole, as a category, I really do believe that the permissionless innovation will way out-compete whatever the centralized social networks, even with their ability to go and try to copy. Yeah, yeah, I like that. It's like almost the more that we build, the easier it will be to onboard people in a way, right? Just cause there'll be so many options that like there, why wouldn't you almost, right? Like if you have the option to communicate with and partake in things that you value highly, like here's your option to go do that eventually if there's enough clients out there that are doing the right thing, so. Cool, man, I appreciate you coming on, Dan. This was an awesome conversation. I have to say like super enlightening, loved your analogies. I learned a ton and I hope my audience does too.
