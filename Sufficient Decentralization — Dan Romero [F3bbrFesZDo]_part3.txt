delegate everything. Whereas, and maybe the nouns is too much. Like I actually, I'm not close enough to it. But I think part of it is I actually want to pay attention to what the smartest people in the space who are actively figuring this stuff out and how to coordinate these decentralized groups. Because if Farc has are successful, it has hundreds of millions, if not billions of people. And in the kind of like idealistic version of me, it's like, how amazing would it be if like, everyone could have a say in how this global internet public commons could work. I think the practical reality of it is, like the reason we have governments have elected representatives is like direct democracy. Actually, I live in California, which I think direct democracy has made some poor, short-term oriented decisions that have had long-term ramifications. But what is the right model that we can actually figure out so that these systems, to your point, where actually everyone has a say based on, you know, the value they contribute or the usage or whatever the right metric is. But also at the same time that they're effective in how they can actually be governed and make decisions, right? I think one of the challenges with like these big L1 blockchains in Bitcoin and Ethereum, and Ethereum, I think part of the story because Vitalik still exists and has I think been an important influence, it's really hard to coordinate those systems. And so I don't think like we've scratched the surface on, it's like, what is the optimal way to kind of like run these decentralized organizations, right? 100%, yeah. I think there's, I think everything moves so fast. And I think like the, what I see you rolling out and where I'd like to take this conversation is in just being very strategic in how you build value. And at C-Club, we like to talk about earning the right to do the next thing. And that's what I see you doing. And so, you know, we have a lot of folks who are community builders, right? And being strategic and tactical about building great community experiences is something that we think a lot about. And I think if we look at even just what you've shared here today, you know, you're saying Farcaster is 4,500 users. That could both seem like a lot, but I think most people would say like, that's a tiny amount of users for a social network. And maybe it has a lot more attention. People, I think that people will be shocked by it, by the number there, even though you have a great open data set that shows users and growth and activity at farcaster.network, which you can go check out. But I would love for you to sort of like help us understand either the frameworks or rule sets or strategy, which you are acting on a regular basis to build valuable experiences within Farcaster. Yeah, so I can only speak to my own experience and to the point about the size, I think about that all the time. Like if I'm on a down day, it's like startup rollercoaster, right? Down day, it's just like, how are you ever going to get to a billion people with 4,500? But then I think like last year, basically at this time, it was probably every day, fewer than 50 people using it. So from that regard, it's like, okay, like we made a decent amount of progress year over year. I also think that the other way to frame it is if the 4,500 people on Farcaster, I'm at least interacting with, you know, a thousand of them or 1,500 of them on some either lightweight way or directly. Even at Coinbase, I never hit that scale. So it's just like, this is actually the largest group of people I've ever been interacting with. And so in some ways, like it is actually a large, like if you just think of 1,500 or 4,500 people in a single room, that's a lot of people. So it depends on how negative or positive you want to be. And I try not to- For the record, I think it's, I mean, what I want to get at here is I think that's a very smart, strategic decision that you have made to go about building this network very slowly and purposefully. Yeah, I'd love for you to sort of share the thinking behind that and maybe some of the other decisions you made. Yeah, look, I think part of it is people can sense quality. I think it's like more cynical business advice assumes like, this is why I hate the term growth hacking. It's like somehow like you're manipulating people or you're figuring out like, oh, like they don't understand. And it's like, you're just the brilliant product person that's able to do it. And I think that there's maybe some truth on the margin. And definitely when you hit scale, like there's a bunch of gimmicks that you can do to juice numbers on here or there. But in terms of like trying to actually build a community, and this is actually one thing, I don't know if it was with you on Forcaster or someone who was like, oh, are you thinking about hiring a community manager? And I'm like, that's my job. Like the whole point, you know, we're a team of six. I did all the front end, but like I'm also doing the product management effectively. And like the only way to be good at product management is like actually dog food the most you possibly can of the product, right? And so like I still continue to be the most active user on the network, like by virtually any metric. Like actually starting to, there are people who are now using it more, which is always kind of wild, because I think I use it a lot. But I think it's like, am I perfect on that? No. And like, is it because my content is like amazing? It's actually just like people can tell when you put effort into things and you're being genuine and it doesn't feel like transactional of like, okay, like I did the one greeting and then I'm on to the next person. And what's challenging about that is like, it just takes time. Like it's like I spend a lot of time. Perk of having a mobile app is I can kind of do this like wherever I am, like I just hop on Forcaster. And one of the things that, for example, I follow everyone on the network. It's not gonna last forever, but by doing so I see every post. And so it's kind of like getting this global feed, but it would be really easy, for example, if I wanted to optimize for my own thing, there are plenty of people I just could unfollow. It's like, okay, I don't have to see this post anymore. But by doing two things, one, it kind of actually forces me to engage with people who if I was like playing Twitter, which is like, I've never run Twitter. So like I try to optimize Twitter for my own benefit. I could easily ignore someone. Whereas now I try to actually engage with someone. Even if maybe I'm like, oh, this post is like a little lower quality or it feels a little shilly, what can I do to actually bring the best out of this conversation? And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And I think that the second thing that Varun and I both try to follow everyone is we basically kind of see where the network is going to be into the future almost, because most people don't follow that many people. And so their experience might be delightful today because they're only following people under the network who know the norms. By the way, every community starts to develop norms. And that's actually one of the biggest things that I've noticed. Like as we've added a lot more people recently, the marginal person listens a little less and they do a little bit more talking because they're kind of bringing Twitter culture in. Whereas I think what makes Farcaster great is like, you know, the classic, what people call engagement farming on Farcaster is people try to ask a thoughtful question and then they get a whole bunch of thoughtful answers. Or it's like the person comes in and they try to do a thread. And it's like, we actually made the UI not work with threads because we're trying to nudge people into like, hey, it's a slightly different modality. But I think with seeing kind of like what the average new user, how they're behaving on the network. And it's a little easier to do this in a public social network with a feed versus like a discord with a bunch of different channels and private conversations that you can't see what are happening. We can be like, huh, interesting. The average person is coming in now and is starting to do a little bit more of like the broadcast rather than engage. What can we do from a product standpoint? And that's the perk of like the community building post product is we can change some of the defaults so that it kind of can nudge things in a different way. And so like one example of this is we haven't had an algo in the app until recently and it's the second tab. It's not the default tab partially because I like the like promise that if I'm following you I get that. But the highlights tab is basically all engaged towards conversations. We actually don't put a lot of weight on likes and recasts which I think on Twitter that I don't know the exact algo but that seems to be more important. And the reason is those questions to me bring the and kind of engagements that actually brings out the best of Forecaster because you actually see a variety of different opinions and people try to give thoughtful answers. And so like, that's a great example of we were organically trying to do that before that tab existed, but by adding that in and showing that as like kind of in the default UI you're slowly nudging the community towards a set of norms that hopefully like whatever set of norms you have that's what actually compounds, right? And so I think that's something and it's one of the things that we're thinking about is scaling is like, we're really, we keep saying this like we wanna scale with quality. We don't wanna grow too fast because then the percentage of the network that's new to the network that doesn't know the norms starts to shift the culture versus if you keep it consistent where you're growing consistently, but not too much the network can almost absorb new people in and kind of teach them the culture. And I think the analogy that I've used in multiple regards and it's not perfect, but if you think of like our client for Forecaster, so Forecaster is kind of like a country. Our client is like New York City and Ellis Island or in the 20th century where most immigrants to the US came in. You had a ton of people stay in that general area and in the East coast, still the most populous densely populated area of the country, right? All different cultures, all different places people are from. But there are plenty of people who moved on from that area and they moved to different States and brought different cultures with them and subgroups and et cetera. But I think that the important thing is like, one, we set the tone when people arrive. And then two, like when you show up to a new country, there are customs and cultures that you, and a particularly a country like the US where they kind of become absorbed, especially into that next generation of people who are here. But it's not like you lose the culture from the country that you came. And so I think that like, it's not a concrete thing, but it's something that I think a lot about, especially because our product feels so much like Twitter, that people, they're gonna behave similar to what the UI shows them. And so that I think is another thing that we think a lot about in terms of the community. Well, I mean, so my moment of like maximum value from Forecaster came when I asked a question, struggling with my calendar, feeling very overwhelmed with the number of meetings that exist and in no world would I post this to Twitter and the density of useful folks who would give me useful information there would just be very low. I think, you know, there's, if I think of like who else has a crazy schedule, it's actually people who are building in crypto and who are doing that at a fairly high level. And actually they're all on Forecaster. Of course, I posted that to Forecaster, how do you manage your Cal time? And it's, you know, in the Twitter sense, it got the most recasts and likes and watches out of everything I've done, but the value was not in that. And that's not what I was searching for there. The value was that the incredible responses from people who I know have gone through the same sort of phase that I'm in right now. And, you know, there's, I mean, it was overwhelming the amount of useful ideas and suggestions that came back. So, I mean, and to see that being prioritized, I think makes a ton of sense. I think also from sort of the outside, there's just very simple things that you do that I think really set this product up for success. One is I think the slow growth, right? So it's not just anybody who can show up there. And I think that curation in an early community has like an important role to play. Not to say that we should all have walled gardens or these gatekeepers, but I think, you know, it's a very smart early decision. Two, yeah, you follow everybody, which like means that when you show up, somebody is greeting you, right? You're walking into the door. You were very generous with your recasts and a lot of people follow you. And so there's sort of like this immediate boost that comes when, and I have the sense that you are doing that in a way that is also sort of nudging people towards the better use of this tool rather than just, so there's like a big social dynamic that exists there, much in the same way where, you know, somebody says thanks to you in a team and if you're working in an office and another sort of culture that gets built there. I think that those three things, even though they're just probably the simplest things that you could just sort of throw away, like as maybe givens, they're just not givens. And I know I struggle with that even thinking about participating in the C-Club Discord on a regular basis, given where my attention is. And I can justify my maybe lack of engagement there as it not being our core community, but very much need to, you know, continue to show up in the way that we want others to show up in our communities. So, and I think you do a great job of that. We are coming up on time here. So I have two things. One, I asked the Forecaster community what questions we should ask you, and we actually touched on many of them. So I want to, you know, shout out Les and Karthik and Ivy, who actually asked her question, and Cyrus and MK for all asking those questions. And I think we got to them in indirect ways, but Ivy, we did not touch on this question. And so I'm going to, maybe we can wrap up with this one. At heart, are you a shape rotator or a word cell? Well, I was an English major in college, so I think it's going to be hard to call me a shape rotator. I think I'm not one to love just like very- Oh, come on. Come on, it's AB. No, no, I'm team word cell, how about that? But I think that there's value in learning from both. And I don't know, he's a controversial person, obviously, but Elon is a good example of, is like definitely a shape rotator, but the reason he has 110 million followers ain't the shape rotating as much as the word selling. So, yeah. Yeah, I love it. I also hate the binary in many ways, but awesome. All right, so my last question for you, I think there's gonna be a lot of people who want to get into Forecaster after listening to this absolute brilliant conversation with you. Can we make five invites available to people? Is that a game you play? We can make more than five invites available. You DM me on Twitter, DWR, ironic, yes, that way to get onto the decentralized social network is DM me on the centralized, but it's actually useful because here's actually what I'm gonna value. So if you have mutuals who are already on there, I've followed now 2,500 people on Twitter, way more than I ever have. And so if people who are on Forecaster I'm following follow you, that's a sign. It bumps it right up to the top of like people I respond to. And if you don't have those mutuals, this is a kind of a newer process. Send me something that you've built, put out into the world. So wrote, art, whatever, show me something that you've actually created. Because I think one thing that has worked really well is that Forecaster has really resonated with people who there's a sense of agency and that they can do something. And it doesn't have to be just code, right? Like you don't have to send me your GitHub, like you can do that. But it's just something that they want to express themselves in a way that is like putting themselves out there. And I think that so far the community is pretty welcoming to that, right? Whether you're doing digital art or writing or screenshot essays or code. And so that would be the thing that's gonna distinguish. I do get a lot of spam on my Twitter DMs now, but I think that one of those things, I go through every single one of them. And especially if you mentioned that you heard it on this podcast, which I've now given this long spiel, like you probably will- C club sent you here. Those are the lines, C club sent me here along with something cool that you've actually done. I love that description of folks with agency. And it's definitely the part of the Twitter world that I love the most is just that most of my active interactions there with those folks. It's a privilege to be able to interact with people both through this podcast and through our community who very much have that as well. I think web three, crypto, whatever we want to call it, I think in at least the pockets of the world that I live in there are so dense with those types of human beings. And it manages to make life a heck of a lot more fun. I would agree. Hey, thanks for having me. Danny, I really appreciate your time, man. And for those listening, shoot down a message, go check out Farcaster and you can give me a follow there too, because I hang out there more often than I probably care to admit, Dan and I were talking about earlier. Apparently there are people who take time off over the holidays to not be on the internet. And I was saying how I don't- I won't be taking time off over the holidays. But so, yeah, me. Yeah, cheers.
