you and you're good for the most part, unless it's obviously a spam bot or something like that. But I'm curious to hear how you've gone about strategically curating this initial community and why that's been so important. We've changed our approach a little bit over the last year. We've been running the beta for about a year now. And the initial approach was I reached out to a bunch of people in my network. I've worked in crypto for almost eight years now. And the kind of time I spent in Silicon Valley, so I onboarded the first 400 people to Farcaster with a Zoom call. So kind of superhuman style, 15 minutes, explain what we were doing, kind of how the architecture worked, and then went through an onboarding where we did a screen share. And it was a desktop client to start, so it was kind of easy to do that. And what was interesting is we had a bunch of churn. These people all knew me, good friends in some cases, but I think a lot of them had existing Twitter audiences and the conversational liquidity was just too low. It was mostly me posting. And I think what ended up starting to work a little bit better was there were a few people of those 400 that stuck around and it was resonating for whatever reason. And they became pretty passionate about saying, hey, you should check out Farcaster. This seems pretty cool. And the next wave of call, another 500-ish or so, were mostly referrals. And I think they retained at a better rate than the initial because they tended to be people who were friends with the people who this resonated with. And on average, I think most of these people don't have existing big Twitter audiences, so their opportunity cost to switch was lower. And that's an interesting point because there's an essay from a friend, Eugene Way, called Status as a Service that I highly recommend everyone read that talks about this. But basically new social networks appeal to people who aren't already in the call it nobility of whatever social network before it. And there's this proof of work in the early days in terms of you kind of earning your chops to build the audience that ultimately compounds it as the network starts to grow. And so that very much played out with Farcaster. But I do think that the other strategy that we shifted over to probably in the last four months, five months, is this DM me on Twitter. And we've added a lot of friction to the signup flow. So what we get out of that is we get really high intent users. And I get plenty of spam Twitter accounts that send me, you know, I would like an invite to Farcaster. But what's interesting is, you know, I follow, I don't know how many people at this point, a thousand people on Twitter, and a lot of people in the crypto world. A lot of people I don't even know, I just, you know, see an account, they get retweeted, they seem to be into crypto, I click yes. And so I get an interesting sample that if you DM me, I can actually see do we have any mutuals in the sense of people I'm following who follow you. And then similarly, just the ability to just go back and forth over to direct messages creates a friction for it is very hard for a bot. I don't know, I don't think I'm failing the Turing test quite yet. But I think you have to be a little bit more intentional. And what's interesting is I basically let anyone in that I kind of pass as a like, okay, you seem like a reasonable human, I can see your public tweets, right? And usually probably don't let an account that's like one month old on Twitter onto Farcaster. And so I think it's worked really well in terms of this kind of curated community. But at some point in the last, you know, four to six months, the conversational liquidity flipped, and it got to a point where it wasn't just me posting a lot. I still post quite a bit, but it got to the point where you could refresh the feed if you're following enough people, and you get new content. And now we're to the point where I still follow everyone on the network for the most part, just a little over 3000 people, and I can't keep up with the feed. Like so it's actually being used during kind of, you know, day, daytime hours, at a rate that is faster than my Twitter feed refreshes, which is kind of wild. So I think we have hit a conversational liquidity point, which is exciting, because that actually is a good launching point for people to want to build apps, there's actually enough data, like real data, in terms of people posting and all the stuff that's associated with that. And I think that the other thing about conversational liquidity, similar to financial liquidity, which I learned a lot about at Coinbase, is liquidity begets liquidity. So now people are actually pinging me on Twitter DM and saying, hey, someone showed me Farcaster at a conference on their phone, and it looked really cool. Can I check it out now? And so the idea that you can actually get to a point where the app can actually be its own advertisement through these referrals, beyond just someone who's really passionate about it, that's been working. And then more recently, it's actually, we've had a lot of these organic tweets, where someone who had reached out to me via DM, onboards to Farcaster, really enjoys their initial experience, then tweets. And then all I've been doing is just retweeting that, or maybe I sometimes quote tweet it with a comment. And it inevitably brings in more people, because they're seeing it's not just me talking about how great Farcaster is, it's actually some other person that, if you see three or four of those endorsements, you're like, okay, might as well check it out. And so, so far, it's been working pretty well. I do think we're going to have a challenge beyond maybe call it 10,000. So we could probably keep doing this strategy for the next few months. But I think beyond 10,000 users signed up, I think we're gonna have to think through new growth strategies. And I always think in orders of magnitude, and I think this peters out at some point. And I think going from 10,000 to 100,000, while trying to maintain some semblance of quality is, I don't have an answer for you, but it's something that we're starting to think about. Yeah, is there any like, milestone that you have in mind in terms of like you mentioned, you know, you have friends who have huge followings on Twitter, and you get them and they're excited about Farcaster, it's, you know, sufficiently decentralized social network, they're all about that, like philosophically and, and everything like that. But, you know, like you mentioned earlier, people just sort of, they can sort of say what they want, or, you know, have these beliefs that they want, but at the end of the day, they sort of just want the experience. And if you have a million people following you on Twitter, and you know, 110 on Farcaster, it's sort of hard to convince yourself to like spend time there as someone who's already really, really established on Twitter. And of course, you can build a huge social network without those people. By definition, the vast majority of people on social media or Twitter specifically, you know, don't have a million, let alone 100,000, let alone 10,000, or even 1000 followers. But at the end of the day, you know, in the long run, you probably want some of these people to come over. So, you know, maybe for example, one milestone could be like, get someone with XYZ number of followers, you know, 100,000, a million to go like full time Farcaster where they're not even tweeting anymore at all, like maybe they spend some time doing both, which like that's currently where I am, right? Like, I'm not willing to stop tweeting to just use Farcaster exclusively right now. But I'm more than happy to post across both. And it feels like a great use of my time because there's an awesome group of people that I've mentioned on Farcaster. And I actually, you know, with like, for my own example, I probably have what, one tenth or even a bit less of the number of followers on Farcaster as I do on Twitter. And yet I find that like for the average post, it's actually better quantity and quality of engagement. So quantity in terms of like, you know, faves and things like this, and then quality in terms of like genuine comments. You can ask a question on Farcaster and you get like real answers versus Twitter. It's like sort of posting into a void a lot of times, or if you do have sufficient following, it's not a void, but it's like a spam, you know, universal spam or whatever. Everyone's just scam posting and things like this. So anyway, I guess that's a long-winded way of asking like, are there any particular goals that you have in mind or just keep executing the processes that you've been running and continue to figure things out as you go? I think I got a little bit more hung up on this last year. And I spent a lot of cycles thinking through, you know, I'm friends with biology and folks like that. And it's like, okay, you're ideologically aligned with something like this. And like, how do I get you to switch full time? But the more I actually think about it from first principles, that threshold is going to be pretty far because of that reach that you have on Twitter, whatever you're trying to do, that's like potentially very valuable, right? The most extreme example of this is obviously Elon, right? Elon's Twitter account is probably, I don't even think Tesla has marketing, right? It's like all of his companies benefit from the fact that he has this massive amount of distribution. So I think I underrated the value of distribution for people on something like Twitter for just like pure professional or gaining additional status. That said, it's something you brought up and I think we will be in a position to quantify this a little bit better over the next six months. But it's the engagement that you can get for the exact same post between Farcaster and Twitter that I think will start to win people over. And if we can continue to focus on quality of signups, so yeah, aggregate total number of followers is going to be smaller. But there was a post today, for example, my friend Jackson, he posted something on Twitter. It was a screenshot essay about just like the frontier of tech and crypto. And I think he got something in the order of 30 something likes and it might be higher now and no replies. And on Farcaster he posted and within 20 minutes he had four replies and there was actually a pretty substantial discussion that happened where it continued to go down the tree in a different direction. And so it was just generating a lot of engagement from people having very thoughtful answers and ways of engaging. And I think that in and of itself is like if you're strictly for the, I want to be able to say I tweeted something out to 100,000 plus people, sure. But if you actually are using the social network for having a real conversation or improving your ideas, I think Farcaster with a very small user base is going to be able to meet or exceed that on average for most people within the next year. And I think that is something to just continue to focus on. And a lot of people actually mentioned that Farcaster feels like early Quora. And the reason I think they say that is that early Quora had very thoughtful replies from a variety of people. And so I think we're not, no guarantees that we can continue to maintain that. But I think deeply from, or I'm thinking deeply about product decisions that we can make that can enhance that and even increase the amount of engagement people get. Because I actually do like this pretty basic indication that like, oh, I read this, I liked it. It's kind of almost like a read receipt. Whereas I think a reply, especially a thoughtful one, that's a lot more effort. And so quantifying the level of engagement per cast relative to the amount of followers people have, I think is an area that we're probably going to double down on. Yeah, I feel like part of it to your point on likes being somewhat like read receipts, I feel like that's just the default response. I mean, the default response, I guess, is to not interact with the tweet that you see at all. And then the default too is to like it if there's sort of any reaction to it positively, basically. And the comment, like almost, I think for a lot of people isn't even a consideration. Whereas on Farcaster, there's a lot of casts that are, you know, posed as questions or soliciting feedback. And it feels like, in a way, commenting is just as equal of a default almost as liking and or faving or whatever. And I don't know, it's like, I don't know how this is going to scale. And to your point, it's going to be definitely a challenge to get, you know, from 10,000 to 100,000, a very different breed of challenge than it was to get to the first thousand and then 1,000 to 10. But it'll be interesting to see how all of this sort of adapts with scale. But certainly for people listening now, I think it's a worthwhile experiment to go get involved with, especially if you don't have a huge following on Twitter, you got nothing to lose, like we've been talking about. So, you know, DM Dan and check it out as long as you're not a bot. But if you're listening, you're probably not a bot. All right. So I want to transition a little bit in closing with a couple of questions on not like personal necessarily very much related to all of this that we're talking about, but not like as exclusively focused on Farcaster. And the first is, well, I mean, this one is sort of focused on Farcaster to some extent, but I'm curious, like just as a founder building a social media platform and a protocol, you know, it's part of your job. Like you said, in the early days, you basically were the feed. And that's less and less the case as you're getting this conversational liquidity. But, you know, being on the platform and interacting on social media, Farcaster in particular, but also Twitter and being in your DMs and things, this is all like very much a part of your job. It's like something that is very beneficial to what you're building. And it's something you have to do and might enjoy doing. But social media is inherently a huge distraction. In addition to all of the great value that it has, it's just a distraction for a lot of people as well. And sort of the, you know, double sided sword or whatever you call it. So how do you manage like, you know, are there any rules you put in place for yourself on like, OK, I'm going to go and and binge for this number of hours at this time and then shut it down for the day? I'm curious just how you manage that thing that for a lot of people like there's no, you know, there's value to being on social networks, but there's not as direct value as building the company. So I'm curious how you balance that as you know, as you're building. Yeah, I think it's definitely a struggle in that sometimes when I'm using Farcaster, I'm wondering, OK, is this actually the best use of my time? But the reality is using your own product and being as much of a power user as anyone on the platform gives you a deeper understanding about the product for that when you do some of that product thinking or shifting over towards like, what should we be building and how you have a very deep, intuitive sense on what works and what doesn't. I think the other thing to consider is so there are different phases of building product for social network, but I suspect that we have shifted for Farcaster is very much right now is actually building the community. And I don't love that word because it's like got a lot of meanings for different people, but or the network, maybe is a better term for it. Is what so when I'm putting effort into to fostering the network or answering people's questions, it creates an interaction that says, OK, this is actually much more human than maybe the kind of void that is the centralized social media or something like a Twitter. So that that in of itself is actually building the company in some ways. And I think it's hard to say, oh, well, just just hire an intern and have them answer people's questions. I don't think it has the same same effect. So in some ways, it goes back to a Paul Graham. I say to do things that don't scale. I don't think you do it forever at the rate that I'm doing it just because I think the network will scale and it's like, OK, then I'll just have to be selective. But I don't think that ever goes away because the moment I stop really engaging at a deep level in the network, I'm going to actually lose the pulse of kind of like how things are going. Like you can only look at so many metrics, dashboards and things like that. I think that the other thing with the kind of like distracting component of social media, and this is one of the reasons I love RSS. So in RSS, you have RSS readers, right? And there's a variety of clients that tend to be in the in the sense that they're not venture backed. And and so a lot of them are either you pay for the software or you subscribe to the software. I use one called Feedbin and I actually have different clients on my iPhone and on my Mac. And so I spent a decent amount of money on software related RSS. But what's cool about it is you get a lot of configurability because the developer to customer relationship is not one of time spent, which ultimately translates into ads. It's one of trying to give you as much utility. And I think that that is an underrated thing that we really haven't explored yet, given that the dominant mode of social networks that won over the last 10 years were all advertising driven. But if you just just use television as an example, think about how wild it is to go and watch network television now, where for any given TV show, you would have a 30 minute slot spend seven minutes watching commercials, right? Post Netflix, which obviously now is adding ads, but Netflix and HBO and like that is a superior user experience. I pay you and I can get the maximum amount of time. And so I suspect what will happen with Farcaster as both with our client, but as more clients start to get billed, is you're going to have developers that offer products that make a different set of trade offs. And there will definitely be a market for people who are willing to trade their time for ads in order to be free. But I can promise you if Twitter offered me a $20 a month subscription, where I could not have to see a single ad, then I would do it. I would do the same thing with Google. I do it with already with YouTube. And what's interesting though, is when you're an advertising based business, you don't want your best customers to shift over to the paid version because now the advertiser is saying, wait a second. So I'm only showing ads to the not as good customers. And look, it's sort of worked for Spotify, but the reality is I think Spotify is much more driven. I don't know the specifics of their financials, but much more driven by their subscription revenue than their free advertising tier. And it's like advertising tier is actually top of funnel to get people to actually upgrade into the subscription tier. And so I think that going back to your point, you could end up in an era where there are five, six Farkaster clients that what they optimize for is given that you might be a subscriber, how much signal to noise ratio they can optimize and save you time. So rather than time spent at saying, hey, rather than spending 10 minutes a day using Farkaster, we're going to shoot to have you only spend eight and we're just going to do a better job through machine learning or whatever to show you exactly the right content and no more. And we don't want you to do scroll. And so I think that's just an interesting model when you actually have business model diversity as a result of permissionless innovation and it being a protocol. Yeah, that's really interesting. I mean, I can't imagine there's obviously there's the ad based model and the subscription model. I think all the reasons you've pointed to as to why subscription is likely superior for for the consumer, at least when it comes to social networks is, you know, that all makes sense. But there's probably a whole nother category of business models that can sort of be incorporated and invented with with crypto and tying that all into everything.
